41e824cbe,"Ara needs a forever home! Believe me, he's a really sweet guy! Here's his story: Ara was found along Jalan Cempaka in Kg Sg Kayu Ara on 18th April, , with a wire cable wrapped tightly around his left hind leg. It had cut almost to the bone and rendered the leg useless. He was rescued and taken to a vet. Thankfully, as Ara was rescued early enough, there was no infection and the leg was saved. It is now almost healed and there does not appear to be any long-term damage to it. In fact, Ara is now able to put his weight on the leg and run, jump (he is an amazing jumper!), and play just like any other dog. Ara was at a fosterer’s since 21st April, , but his resources are stretched as he has his own dog. Therefore, he has since been sent to PAWS Animal Welfare Society on 3rd June . Between the vet and the fosterer, Ara’s mild case of tick fever was also addressed. We urge any kind soul to adopt Ara and bring him home with you. He's a well-mannered and friendly dog with a penchant for playing with balls and shuttlecocks. He is easy to bathe and walk and is good with children, including young ones. From his behaviour and mannerisms, Ara was likely someone else’s pet before, but he is also very street smart now, no doubt due to his time as a stray. Please give Ara a home if you can. We really hope he doesn’t have to go back to being a stray. Thank you for your consideration, and please share! You may visit him at PAWS. Please quote his tag number as listed next to his name at the top of this page to the staff at PAWS. PAWS Animal Welfare Society Pilmoor Estate, Subang Airport Road, Subang, Selangor, Malaysia"

9b3e95995,"This is Bailey's journey :- Tuesday, /, lunch time, I’ve found an abandoned dog with skin problem. She was two cars apart from me & I whispered: “Do you need help?” and she came over to me. I took her to my regular vet for checkup. Her skin problem is not contagious but needs a longer time to recover. (demodex) Name : Bailey Age : -+ 1 year old, female. Vaccinated. Neutered. As at Oct About : She knows SIT, STAY, COME, WIPE & Mum-Mum (for food). She does her poo & pee in my balcony instead of inside her cage. She’s a happy & a playful dog. Afraid of human crowd, time is needed to gain her trust again :) Currently, I’m fostering 5 dogs. This has created a strain in my marriage. For those who have been with me for the past few months, I thanked you all from the bottom of my heart. It has been 4 months since Bailey is residing in my regular vet. This has incur much in my financial as I am only a solo rescuer. Help me so that I would be able to continue with my rescue mission. She’s no longer an abandoned dog anymore, she has a name. I’m currently nursing her but this has created some problems at home. I have tried most of the shelters but of no use. Some are not fit to take her in when I visited the place just to make sure. Some shelters have rejected my pledge too and I respect their decision making. I’m one step away in finding a good owner for her. Could you lend me a hand in finding one for her, please??"

4cfd0fac0,"In June,,Mohawk was trapped.Never in his life was he ever confined or looked at 2 feet away by crowd of inquisitive eyes with hostility.Worst still, he was struck on the skull ended up with a medusa shaped wound with raw flesh exposed ( Pic 2 ). Naturally, He was very traumatised. Could we blamed him for behaving aggressively to all near his cage. He was just trying to frighten intruders away to save his own skin. How else ? He is an animal & confined in a cage amidst a crowd of milling people.He was to be euthanized but SAS thought otherwise. It took us 4 months for him to trust us.We named him Mohawk. His colouring is like an Red Indian with a band of white against rich brown diagonally across his neck.His ears are upright.His chest is white & he has white socks too with a bushy tail. Furthermore, he moves as if he is on a hunt. Mohawk is not aggressive at all. Infact, he plays like a child. All our Ketum dogs play like kids. They don't play in any aggressive manners. For a time , he likes to come near & lift the kennel hand's skirt.He loves his name & pricks up his ears whenever called. 2 teenagers lads told their dad he looks like a film star. Indeed, he does & wants him. Mohawk ia a beauty who must have space & one who cares enough to build up a bond with him. When you do , you willbe proud of him for he will give you presence."

c634af483,"Greetings to all the dog lovers, Simba and Sandy are sisters, so they kinda stick together all the time, which is really really cute! :) They were found and rescued by my family member and I when they were about 2 months old. My parents always wanted me to put them up for adoption as I already own 3 dogs and I will be leaving to Overseas to further my studies. However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the ""Lion King"" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the ""stranger"". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent. Both of them are the perfect family dogs and they can guard the house pretty well. #FunFacts about them that make them adorable: 1. They are afraid of fireworks. 2. They are always wag their tails when you are home! 3. They love being pet and never get sick of being complimented. 4. Just simply because they are super ADORABLE AND LOVABLE!"

They are about 2-3 weeks old and are all healthy and very strong. We are currently nursing them, feeding them every 2-3 hours. Unfortunately we will be unable to keep these adorable kittens for very long as my parents don't like cats and we are relying on the kindness of our friends to take turn in hosting the kittens. This is our first rescue and we will really like to see them find a happy and loving home. Please neuter/spay them at the proper age.

d08d2829f,"Bambi was found in the middle of the road in Segambut in the evening (near KTM Segambut) and was pushed to the roadside by a kind man. At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying. Facebook gallery (contains wound):"

63d254530,"Tabatha was rescued along with 7 other kittens after someone rounded them up and threw them away in a box by the roadside. They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated."

ff127e4d3,"For those who have no knowledge about husky breed, kindly do google search about this breed before contact me via EMAIL. Thank you. I'd love to find someone to adopt my 2 huskies. They were dognapped before about a year ago, we went high and low searching and distribute flyers around neighbourhood. We knew the possibility to find them back is slim as they were dognapped, not lost. After few months, we adopted a mongrel whom originally was our neighbour's dog. He was beaten every night until he became our dog. Few months back, we saw a lost&found picture of our huskies on facebook. They were dumped in Ampang, therefore we went and picked them back. It was a miracle, couldn't be more happy. When we brought them back, the huskies cannot get along with my mongrel, they were very tensed. Having no choice, both of them stay in my kitchen area as I don't have a big compound for them to run. I wish to seek for someone who can adopt both of my huskies together (1 male & 1 female), they has been very attached to each other all these year. No adoption fee is required, only requirement is for BOTH to stay together and adopter is required to spay and neuter them. In anytime adopter feel uncomfortable adopting them, they must return them back to me. Please email me at if you are interested."

Meet Jack the Peanut, one of two surviving pups available for adoption. Born on 3rd-April-, there were initially about 5-6 pups but the rest mysteriously disappeared over the first 2 weeks. Nicknamed peanut because of how tiny it actually was when born into the world. It's still rather tiny when compared to his sister. Jack has a slight case of skin problem on the right hind leg & a couple of tiny patches on the body. Probably due to falling into the dirty drains one too many times. We have been applying Arnica Compound Gel on the affected area and it seems to be doing wonders. The fur seems to be growing back nicely. Jack the Peanut & Jill the Walnut had their first bath last week and are still looking fluffy. 3 new pics have been updated to the profile (26-5-13).

Unfortunately we are unable to keep Maxie and his brood of four due to municipal council rulings. We live in a small single storey house with no compound. We are urgently looking for great animal lover(s) who can provide Maxie with tender, loving, care. *Conditions for adoption: -Must be kept indoors / home environment. -No excessive tying and caging. -No wander/free roaming of neighborhood without supervision -To provide medical care and vaccination whenever need arises. If you are keen to adopt Maxie, please contact Peter at or Jenny at. Look forward to hear from you!"

b517c8c90,Pls adopt this lovely girl. She is still on the street. We have spayed & vaccinated her. *** We believe these 2 puppies were dumped by the roadside together with their other siblings by the worker from the factory nearby. The foreigner worker conveyed to us during the feeding session at night that the boss asked us to take puppies away without thinking that we have our limitation in term of space. Both of them deserve so much more than to be homeless & rooming on the street & might be harm. Do contact if you can adopt them. Adoption saves life! Txs

8a2faaf1f,"Arya is a rescue kitten. She was found, alone, under a car on the streets. She was severely dehydrated, constipated, malnourished and was fighting an infection at the time of the rescue. She was taken to the vet to be dewormed and to get the proper medication. Since then (3 months), Arya has recovered and has grown into a cute and playful kitten. Arya is really playful and enjoys the outdoors. She is a keen explorer, but she will always come back. Arya is also very fond of cuddling. She will sometimes curl up on your lap or even lay next to you and sleep. Arya is also quite intelligent, she finds her way back. She is also adorable because she will follow you around and will greet you at the door (when you come home). She is friendly with other humans and is good with kids (but sometimes she's a bit too playful and jumps around). Arya is really an adorable cat. She is still small and growing. Ever since rescuing her, she has grown so much and is stronger and better now. I would love to watch her grow and take care of her, but my circumstances don't allow me to do that. Arya deserves a proper home and an owner who will commit, love and care for her."

ca587cb42,"Ponky and his siblings were abandoned at our housing area. He is a healthy, active kitten and very talkative. He is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his siblings - Inky and Pinky, although this is not a must. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and would not know how to survive outdoor. Being a new environment, he might also runaway if kept outdoors. He is very good with our cats. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters."

However, he feels a bit sad because we do not have time to walk and play with him anymore :( We are hoping to find Joy a good master who could spend time with him and provide him a good shelter. I am looking for someone who has experience in taking care of dogs, and whose house with compound in Klang Valley to contact me.

Our Mum is a small-medium dog and we will remain cute. Please find us a home. One of our sisters has been adopted already. We were checked out at the vet yesterday evening where Dr. Yeoh weighed us and checked us over. We got dewormed. We have a very mild fungal infection that the shampooing today should fix. In a few weeks time, we need to be vaccinated too. That brings us to the fact that our friend is not going to be in Malaysia much longer. She has to leave the country and we will be 'homeless' again.

She loves being pet and will lie on her back for belly rubs and tickles. ♥ Bessy needs time to adjust to other dogs, she is however extremely loving towards people (she's good with cats too!). She likes crashing near people's feet before grooming herself/falling asleep. ♥ Bessy is quite playful and loves chew toys (lots and lots of them). She is not hyper however and is rarely noisy (unless caged). ♥ Bessy has been going ""potty"" in the garden since her first foster day (% success when going poo, mishaps sometimes when going pee). She will never mess up her sleep/play area. ♥ Bessy is able to eat puppy kibbles independently (she will appreciate some yummy canned/cooked meat now and then though!). ***PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters*** ♥ Bessy will only be ready to leave to a new home in 10 days time (Oct 8th). A slight portion of her fur had to be shaved to treat a tiny wound (healing well). She has a course of antibiotics to complete. ♥ Bessy will appreciate an indoor environment, she loves loves lovesss spending time with people (adoption priority given to people practicing this). ♥ Bessy MUST be spayed/neutered at the right age (No breeding). Please drop me an email or call if interested. Details about your past experience with dogs and puppies will be much appreciated. Thank you! :)"
5c60f7300,"Mr Fluffers and Cocochino were rescued from the streets of my neighborhood with their mother and sister a few months ago. They are two little beauties with the smoothest, glossiest fur i have ever touched. These brothers are extremely close and I want them to be ADOPTED TOGETHER. Mr fluffers is the leader of the two as he is more daring, outgoing, and openly affectionate. Cocochino harbors some fear of strangers and it took him a long time to warm up to me. He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at . Adopter must be a very patient person as Cocochino will not be immediately friendly, must be willing to put in effort to build a relationship with these boys, a true cat lover. The succesful adopter will have to reimburse me for Mr Fluffers and Cocochino's neutering and vaccinations at which point i will hand over their medical booklets. This means the adopter must pay me back for what i have spent on their neutering and vaccinations. I don't make a profit. They have received their first and second vaccinations. Diet: Acana Kitten kibble, Natural Balance canned food. Litter trained: Use the litter box without fail. Grooming: Because they've got pretty long hair, they may need occasional grooming. Neutered: /08"

9a9f6c753,"Here's Sassy's story. She used to be a stray dog on the streets, she gave birth to a few puppies who died. Opposite the street that she lived in was another female dog and her puppies. Unfortunately this dog died and Sassy decided to feed this new litter of puppies. She was also very protective of this litter of puppies that she whined whenever my dad and I tried to take them away (so sweet right?). She managed to nurture 2 puppies back to health but the rest died. We took her in after a while and she was an amazing pet. She is so tame and was able to learn the rules in our house in no time (much faster than my own dogs). She is loving and a wonderful guard dog. Unfortunately we have to give all our dogs a way. So i hope someone who appreciates a good pet, watchful guard dog and a gentle companion is willing to take her in."

42b3d53f8,"Very cute kitten looking for a home! We found this little girl abandoned in the street the other day and we brought her home to clean her up and help her find a good family. She is not shy at all! walked right up to us looking for a bite to eat. She was so sweet and friendly that we put up posters in the area to make sure no one had lost a kitten but got no reply. She is about 4-5 weeks old, has beautiful and unique orange and grey markings with a white belly and chest. favorite pass time is cuddling although she loves to play too. She purrs the second you get close to her and loves attention. Whats more impressive is she really entertains herself and is definitely not a high maintenance pet. We travel quite often for business which makes it very difficult to keep a pet in the house. The sooner we find her a good home the better as we will be leaving the country several times in December! Please contact me if you would like to see more pictures, have any questions or would like to come meet her in person. I cant stress enough what an amazing pet she will make!"

05e3bc1ae,"Hey everyone! Klover was rescued by my mom and I from a street nearby my place. We fell for her the moment we saw her because she was unlike any other stray dogs to us. Klover has the brightest of eyes and the most alarming German Shepherd like ears! Though we were strangers to her at first, she kept coming close to us with her head nudging our legs asking for a pat on her head, in her way :) We took Klover home becuz we wanted to look for a home for her to live in. The outside can be extremely dangerous and we would not allow her to be caught by the authorities. My mom and I wish to take her under our care permanently but we can't do that because we're living in a condo. It would be mean of us to keep her in such a small area because she's big and more of an outdoorsy doggy. She is of camel and kangaroo brown colour with a white chest. Klover is very loving and passionate towards her caretakers. Throughout her stay here with us, she has been with me from accompanying me whenever I nap to accompanying me whenever I do my study revisions. Klover is rather playful and always opts for a belly rub. She doesn't make much noise as she doesn't bark much. However Klover girl would make this doggy ''purr'' whenever she loses sight of you. That purr literally melts my heart everytime :) Klover deserves a family who is able to give her lots of love and care. She would be better off living in a house with a compound bcuz after all that is one of the main aspects we're looking for in a home for her. I'm also pretty sure she'll do well with a family with kids. Gentle Klover is a total sweetheart, I can guarantee you that. She's so sweet and very loyal. All Klover needs is a good home :)"

But after a few weeks, his eye looked better and the infection was starting to clear up. Now he's a healthy bouncing kitten, proving to be the most adventurous and rebellious among his other 3 siblings. He is also the fattest kitten as he always fought the hardest for his mother's milk. He's so small he can fit in your hands! And he got his mother's blue eyes."

I foster them for a night with Pet's own milk. Then handed over to Kah Yein (founder of animalcare.org)to foster for more than a month now.

She saw me but i was too scared to approach her. I regretted then as that night, it was raining ""cats & dogs"" as the humans would say. And i was so cold and scared. The following day, it was also raining so heavily that i fell into the drain. Thankfully my rescuer mommy pass by the following day again.

f3629735d,"""I know black kitties like myself are stereotyped as being least adoptable, but I didn't come this far for nothing and my plan is to prove everyone wrong!"" --------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome Bagheerah! ♥ Bagheerah was a stray cat rescued from a restaurant in Puchong on the 2nd of March, . ♥ He had an awful case of mange at the time and was also incredibly thin and malnourished. A check at the vet found hookworms, fleas and also that he had flu. Bagheerah has since bloomed tremendously and is now seeking a loving family. --------------------------------------------------------------- Details: ♥ Bagheerah is an EXTREMELY affectionate boy and loves, loves, LOVES people! (Please view videos below, although only visits could do his character justice!). ♥ A softie - Bagheerah is extremely gentle. Would do great in homes with elderly people or children. He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food. Hands down one of the best cats we've ever fostered! :) --------------------------------------------------------------- ***Important (Note for adopters)***: ○ Bagheerah would prefer being kept % indoors for his own safety. He loves trips to the garden under supervision now and then. Apartments best if cat-safe. ○ He would also appreciate a healthy diet (no commercial foods like Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for the long term welfare of any cat, feel free inquire if unsure. Please drop me an text (WhatsApp) or call directly if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a new life. Thank you! :)"

She's very nice and likes rubbing against people. In other words, she's quite ""manja"". She knows when she does something wrong as she hides and peeks at you from her hiding spot after a scolding. She enjoys playing 'catching' and hide-and-seek. She'll look at you playfully and when you're near her, she'll turn around and run off, hoping you'll catch and play with her. She knows how to do her business in the cat litre. She has also started hunting for little insects such as lizards, cockroaches and small bugs! She'll grow up to be a great hunter, leaving a house with no visible insects! :)"

f663a91e8,"For more pics go here: 9th April edit: I have revised the adoption fee to RM to include the fee I paid her breeder. The reason I am now making reimbursement of the breeder's fee compulsory is to help out Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better (MDDB) - they are currently in dire financial straits (read this for details and please help if you can: ). Previously if Donut's adopter voluntarily reimbursed the breeder's fee I had planned to donate the RM to MDDB anyway, since they really need funding I reckon a sincere adopter won't mind the expense as it's going to a good cause. 6th April edit: The family who intended to adopt Donut backed out due to personal reasons (hectic things going on in their lives, nothing to do with Donut herself). So this bundle of beagle-y joy is up for adoption again! :) 5th March edit: I have had people contact me asking if she's old enough to mate. Apparently some people can't read - DONUT HAS BEEN SPAYED. Meaning she can't get pregnant. If you want to adopt her with the intention of breeding her, don't bother contacting me. Donut is an affectionate beagle that loves human and canine company. Trained to do toileting on grass and knows a few tricks - sit, paw, high five, up, down, stand, responds to her name and stays on command in the presence of food. Well socialised and impervious even to thunderstorms (she will calmly snooze under whichever car's in the porch whereas my adult dog will be running around in a panic)! She has some good and bad traits typical of beagles. The good: She's a pack animal as beagles are bred to be and therefore gets along well with other dogs (plays happily with my lab pup and even my temperamental adult mutt). Very friendly even with new people - strangers are constantly delighted when they approach her. The bad: She loves digging holes in the garden (a common problem with beagles). So if you love gardening and your lawn must look immaculate she is not the dog for you. She will also chew stuff you leave lying around which is typical behaviour for all teething puppies. 9th April edit: This isn't necessarily a good/bad thing as it's a natural inclination due to her breed (beagles were originally bred to hunt), but forgot to mention, Donut has a high prey drive when it comes to small animals and cannot be trusted unsupervised with them. She has killed squirrels and birds that wandered into my garden so if you have small animals as pets in your home (rabbits/hamsters/sugar gliders etc.) she would not be a good fit. She's curious and friendly with adult cats when supervised but I would not advise keeping her if you have kittens as I'm not sure if she might mistake them for prey to hunt due to their small size. For those who might wonder why this lovely dog is up for adoption: She is the product of an irresponsible breeder - I'd rather not go into details because remembering how she came into being in my care makes me mad =/ Initially I was hoping to keep her but being a person who believes one should spend a lot of quality time with his/her dog, I've reluctantly come to the conclusion that with 2 dogs of my own I just cannot give Donut the attention she deserves. I spend at least 2 hours a day with my dogs - my opinion is that if you only have time to feed your dog and give it a quick pat as you leave for work/return, then you do not have enough time for a dog. I hope she will find a loving home where love can be lavished on her instead of her present situation where she is receiving limited attention. Adoption fee is for covering her vaccination (she has had the full set of shots) and spaying costs. On top of those expenses I had to pay off the breeder to have Donut released to me (otherwise the breeder would have dumped her at SPCA or pawned her off to the first willing buyer who may have turned out to be a backyard breeder). If you are a serious adopter and able to reimburse me for the breeder's fee (RM) this would be greatly appreciated - I will donate the reimbursed amount to a dog rescue organisation. [PLEASE NOTE the 9th April edit on top of this listing - the breeder's fee is now compulsory.) I am going to be blunt and state upfront that I can afford to be very selective about the home she goes to and will be. After all, pedigreed dogs are more popular (I wish more people would love mixed breeds just as much, but this is the unfortunate reality) and I am in no hurry rehome her. My priority is finding Donut a home where she will receive more love and attention than I can give her at the moment. Bearing the above in mind, these are my conditions for adoption: 1. You MUST have time for her. Donut thrives on attention - when I first fostered her she had separation anxiety and would whine and howl if there were no humans or dogs to keep her company (with training she is now a confident dog). As such I strongly prefer a home where there is a friendly dog for companionship. If Donut will be the only dog in the household, I would prefer if the household has someone able to give her constant attention (i.e. retiree/homemaker/work-at-home/kids). 2. No tying or caging up (unless you find a constantly howling beagle particularly enjoyable....). 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover medical costs and breeder's fee. 4. Patience with destructive behaviour that is inevitable with all puppies. 5. Maintain her on a premium kibble (she is currently on Orijen)/raw food diet. 6. Allow me to visit in the beginning to check on her wellbeing (as such I am looking for adopters in the KL/Selangor area so that this is possible). 7. Lavish her with love, love and more love! :) I would appreciate it if you could email a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, which area you live in, your household situation (what type of home you live in, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and why you would like to adopt Donut. I will get back to you with my contact number for further discussion."
2d72ef0c4,"We found Har-nee with a swollen and almost severed paw. We sent it to the vet and crowd-funded her amptutation. Her front left leg is amputated up to the thighs. She is recovering well from surgery and can move freely with three legs. She is extremely tame and friendly, and would wag her tail like a pendulum to anyone who's nice to her. Like most strays, she does not poop or pee in the house compound and will only do so when you take her out for a walk. We really wish that we could keep her but we are all students who live away from home. Right now we are rotating her between different houses to avoid getting caught by landlords. We definitely don't want to put her back on the streets so if you are looking for a dog, please consider giving her a chance.

She will tilt her head asking for more and sometimes even crash into your hands/lap, she has a knack for resting herself wherever she wants! ♥ Mabel is a confident girl and always the first to explore (in comparison to her sister, Bessy). She is perfectly fine in the company of other dogs (she likes cats too!). Mabel is not hyper when playing nor is she noisy (unless caged). ♥ Mabel has been going ""potty"" in the garden since her first foster day (% success when going poo, mishaps sometimes when going pee). She will never mess up her sleep/play area. ♥ Mabel is able to eat puppy kibbles independently (she will appreciate some yummy canned/cooked meat now and then though!). ***PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters*** ♥ Mabel will only be ready to leave to a new home in 10 days time (Oct 8th). She has a course of antibiotics to complete. ♥ Mabel will appreciate an indoor environment (adoption priority given to people practicing this). She was initially shy of people but has come out of her shell, her exposure must be maintained. ♥ Mabel MUST be spayed/neutered at the right age (NO breeding).

1b368f29c,Hi there! My brother and I are looking for a few kind souls that are willing to adopt these poor little kittens that my brother found abandoned at a wet market in Subang Jaya. There are about 13 of them and the numbers keep on increasing as there seem to be some people who keep abandoning new born kittens there. We would take them in but we're spatially and financially restricted. We already have 4 cats at home. WE really hope you can consider (and ultimately) adopt at least one of these cute little kittens and provide a wonderful loving home for them. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have more questions. We can arrange a visit to where they are now if you want.
21b90ff68,"Due to moving to a new residential that doesn't allow pets, we're unable to keep May as a part of our family. We will truly miss her and hope that someone can give her a new loving home. May is friendly and loving, but also a very good guard dog. She doesn't bite or is destructive to things - even our shoes and slippers were completely untouched! May is pretty obedient, when we need her to head into her cage she does it obediently on command. We used to give her car rides often too, so she loves it and doesn't panic while in it. Another lovable trait is that she almost behaves like a cat! She loves to keep her body close on an owner's leg, often sitting down or taking naps next to the closest human being. We hope someone will give her a home as we don't want to send her to adoption shelters. :("

Thank you to all who choose adoption instead of buying :) --------------------------------------------- Free adoption but vaccinations and neutering surgery for the puppies are a MUST. We will follow up with adopters for the vaccinations and help to schedule neutering surgery when the pups are old enough. **** IMPORTANT!! **** % of puppies make a lot of noises and cry a lot for the first few days or weeks when being adopted. Because they're being separated from their mother and siblings and also unfamiliar with the new environment. They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt?

They were fairly friendly pups who were fostered in only a tiny toilet as their ""home"" (where they ate/slept/poo/pee-ed). They lived for months with almost zero outside world or human contact, and this eventually took a toll on them. ♥ Both siblings were later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). Worse yet, their spirits had been killed and they had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- Good news though!! ♥ Prada and Louis have been under proper foster care and have already made TREMENDOUS progress! ♥ Louis is absolutely friendly (see pics of him below), while Prada is getting extremely curious and edging closer to us day by day. ♥ Prada & Louis are also VERY alert, will bark and make good watch-dogs (not guard-dogs). At other times they have very laid back temperaments. ♥ Both Prada and Louis are looking for understanding and loving new families who can show them the love and life that they lost as puppies, to help them break out of their past endurance entirely. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Prada and Louis should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for temporary needs).

f95b27325,"Hello everybody! My name is Winnie. My rescuers named me that because I look like a bear! So Winnie the Pooh was the inspiration for my name. Just like Mr.Pooh, I'm adventurous and very loving! I can't stop wagging my tail when i hear my name being called! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!"

e736f4022,"This kitten is blind. Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances. Someone please save this little kitten !!!"

a06a2ee4e,"If you are looking for an independent, toilet trained good watchdog, Big George is the answer. He walks well on leash, doesn't pull and listens to instructions. Does his toilet during walks twice a day or on the lawn if you have a garden. He is loving and very loyal to owner. Alert and great watchdog with a loud deep bark. A good, obedient and easy dog to manage. He was found in Sg Buloh just after CNY . We believe he is an abandoned pet. He is bigboned, weighs 25 kgs with a longish snout and suspected to be cross with Saint Bernard. George is best as a single dog or with female dogs only. No tying up or caging. Please call if you can give him a good home."

It is best to have just him instead of having other dogs in the house as his spitz lineage and gender makes him very instinctively dominant . He's groomed regularly at the salon and is a well loved pet . Reason for being put up for adoption : I will be leaving the country soon and do not want to subject him to fly with me as Australia has very strict rules about pets , therefore it will be a long and stressful process for Max to relocate with me . // Interested parties please drop me a whatsapp with a short profile of you , your location and your history with pets .

Anyone who is serious about adopting MACO may contact us at . ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This little boy, Maco was found abandoned at the door front of a kind-hearted lady. He was injured and there were 5 maggots infected wounds on his body. Due to the limited space in the lady's house (as she also home rescued animals she found), she was unable to foster Maco but to passed him to our volunteer to temporary help in fostering and care for him while healing. Maco's wounds were about to recover fully now. But his condition was not well previously as the wounds were badly infected by bacteria and led to canine abscess. After an entire week on antibiotic prescription, the abscess and wounds did not heal. Thus the vet had to make injection on the wounds hoping to promote healing. * Maco has very unique brindle coat + he is totally adorable. However, he can be considered as pretty energetic and playful too. Adopter needs to be patient, with care and love for animal and to have sufficient time to spend with him."

4715f897c,"On the 2/1/, while i was parking my car for work i stumble a female mongrel dog together with 6 puppies lying on a deserted house opposite subang airport. The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain. There are 6 more puppies plus the mother dog waiting for adoption."

6f3e4618d,"Blackie was found when he was a pup. He has unique fur markings (white paws and white neck,like wearing napkin) Sweet nature and quite playful(during evening/nighttime). Loves bath time so extremely no hassle. Will adapt well to dogs but not cats. Good guard dog, will bark at strangers. Knows how to sit, and laying down. (down-down) I decided to put him up for adoption because he deserve a sweet loving home and not roam the streets. T&C: 1. must vaccinate,de-worm and spay him. 2. Cannot be chained for long period. 3. Free to roam (porch or inside house) 4. Must provide (at least) monthly update. Please message/whatsapp me. Strictly no calls. I will get back to you as soon as I see your message."

aeda0ac0d,"A stray cat gave birth to 5 kittens in my garden. 1 has been adopted, and there are now 4 left. Only 3 are up for adoption right now though. They have been treated for mange, fleas, and worms so far. Their skin looks a bit sad in the photos because of the mange. It'll get better in a week or so! The 3 kittens up for adoption are Riley (black and white, girl), Aspen (cream, boy), and Reagan (black and white, boy). They are all 6 weeks old right now and will be ready to go to their new homes at 8 weeks. The RM50 will be returned to you when you spay/neuter the kittens at 4-6 months. Absolutely NON negotiable! These kittens MUST be sterilized. No exceptions. They must also be vaccinated at the appropriate ages. They are all very friendly and playful. Will not bite or scratch. They have been hand-fed by me, so they are very human oriented. Please e-mail/sms me if you are interested in giving these lovely kitties a new home. Tell me about yourself please, I do not want to receive one line queries asking ""are they still available?"" or ""can I have one?"". These emails will not be entertained. So please, tell me about yourself, your experience with cats/animals, whether or not you have pets of your own, and your living situation (do you rent? own? live with parents?). Any info that you think will help me get to know you better is welcomed! ----------------------------------------- Some personality info: Aspen - He's the adventurer; very brave and always the first to check anything out. He doesn't get scared easily and is very calm. He looks like he's always thinking about something and analyzing the situation! He's a very confident and independent little kitty. Riley - She always makes the MOST noise! Especially when she eats. All you hear is *slurpslurpslurp* *nomnomnomnom* It's so cute! She LOVES to eat. She's becoming kind of pudgy too! But she's very playful and adventurous too. Likes to climb everything and play hide and seek/wrestle with the others. Reagan - He's the quiet one. He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held. He's such a sweet little kitty. I call him the cuddlebug! Additional info: All the kittens have been socialized with my dog, so they are OK with dogs too (small dogs)."

1bd200942,"Brim (short for Brimstone) was rescued by me three months ago. I found him near death and with severe, chronic mange, ticks, ulcerated wounds, an ear abscess and severely malnourished. After a few weeks of patient, loving kindness and veterinary attention he is now a very healthy, lively dog with a gentle nature. Brim is a special dog with an unusually gentle nature. It appears Brim may have been abused before being thrown into the street. He is shy around strangers and becomes nervous with loud noises. He would NOT be suitable as a guard dog. His temperament is too soft but he will make a great family pet and so I'm looking for a genuinely loving person or family willing to give Brim a lot of love and freedom to run around. Ideally this would be in a quiet part of the country or in a home with a large garden. I have started training him. He's now house trained, sits and comes on command and will leave the room when told to do so. He is also leash trained and will walk to heel. As I am only visiting Malaysia I need to find Brim a suitable home as a matter of urgency. If interested please email or phone [no messages please]."

a9391d398,"This sweet girl we called Frigga, was found wandering outside my house area on Saturday (). We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days. PLEASE, anyone who would want a manja/loving dog who is playful and sweet, give her a new permanent home. She is friendly with people and even my cats.. :)"

16ffedcf8,"Hello, my name is blessing. I had a very hard life. I had an accident several months ago , my right front leg was badly injured, I had to drag my leg when I walked. Later, it became infectious. The pain was unbearable. Everywhere I went, people despised me. Then I found a place at a parking lot in a big condo where I could hide and rest. A lady who lives there noticed me while on her way to work. She was kind to me. As days passed, I began to trust her. One day I threw myself in front of her car and blocked it. I did not move till she came down and saw my condition. She called for her sons and one of her friends for help but i only trusted her, she put a leash on me and sent me to a nearby clinic. By then my leg was badly damaged , the vet had to amputate my front leg. After one week, i was discharged from the clinic but the lady dose not have any place to keep me so she asked somebody for help. My picture was posted up in facebook and lots of good-hearted people called and offered to foster me till I recover. Now I'm fully recovered and in need of a forever loving home. I am a very sweet girl , cheerful and playful dog. Please give me a chance to have a good life. Thank you."

It's really urgent I find him a home soon. Do pm me if interested, thank you. I really think he is of a mixed breed as his fur coat and eyes seem to suggest. My guess would be part siamese!

We bathed the cat, given it food, milk and keep in a dog cage. We did not intend to keep it for long term, because we already have a dog. Then we thought if this cat could get along with our dog, we would keep her. We made a few attempts, it did not wok.

I'm pretty sure she was dumped because she's extremely friendly and can poop in a litterbox like a champ. We're looking for a home for her. She's been dewormed and is taking some drops for congestion but is otherwise clean, healthy and stupidly adorable. Edit: We're also giving a 4kg bag of Royal Canin Babycat, a bag of litter and assorted food things, plus splitting the costs of her eventual spaying. Yes, I am totally bribing people to take her."

She was hiding among some parked motorcycles and i saw her when she suddenly darted out and attempted to scamper across the road. At the moment Vicky has the flu but i'll bring her to the vet after work. Once she's recovered she will need a permanent, loving home with a responsible family. Vicky has about half the length of a full tail and although she's not feeling well, she's already playful and affectionate.

A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. photos of vicky are coming soon! first she needs a trip to the vet and lots of rest. Vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless kittens like vicky starving and suffering in the streets.. Preferably INDOOR only. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Vicky. - See if potential adopter and Vicky are suitable for each other. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Vicky vaccinated before being able to take Vicky home.

732a2ed35,"Active, healthy, confident pup looking for a loving home where it could call it ""home sweet home"". The RM fee is to subsidize for spaying the dog. If you are committed to caring for a dog for its' lifetime, I am sure it would be the best thing that can happen to your life as well. Alpha seem to be a confident dog. From the videos, you could see that size does not matter !!"
707b0c535,"He puts up a front and acts mean in front of strangers but in actual fact, is a lovable and well-meaning dog. It all depends on how you approach him. He generally tends to bark at anyone that passes by the house (or if there's a cat or a noisy vehicle) but it's only because he's protective of the masters of the house. He's a well-groomed and active dog that needs a lot of exercise in the morning before you leave the house. If not, he has a nasty habit of chewing anything in sight. If you do intend to adopt him, I think it would be best to channel has energies by enrolling him in agility courses or even guard/watch dog training. He likes to play fetch with a ball and I like setting him loose leash in a safe open space to play and run around with him. He knows the basic commands but is not always obedient and tends to get distracted. Though when it comes to meal times, he will always obey! He needs a firm, stable, cool-headed and knowledgable ""pack leader"" that will give him the EDA (Exercise, Discipline, Affection) that I currently can't afford to give him. If you think you fit the description, please give me call to set up a viewing appointment!"

I really Really really really hope someone can give them a home. =( They might get caught by MPSJ soon. 1) ""Wong"" which is the yellow female dog -When I came to Subang, she was abandon as a puppy nearby my hostel. She gave birth once and then it was spayed. She is a very fat and healthy dog. One of the most friendly stray I came across. 2) ""Choi"" which is the black male dog -It is super dependent on ""Wong"" and friendly to human too. He always get bullied by other stray dogs here, only Wong actually loves him, they will lick each other every time. If either one of them was gone, I don't know how they live their lives again. Although they are not expensive breeds but they can definitely bring joy to your life. They both located at Subang area. I can send to your place if you really can take good care of them. My contact is Darren I can provide health check fees and vaccination for them. Please please please please please please please give them a HOME. contact me please."
6df350974,"Say hello to Galaxy boy  This adorable fluffy, green eyed handsome boy was rescued from a park. Once rescued he required a lot of love and affection to reduce any stress and recover from any sickness as he was found wandering all alone. The tiny gorgeous boy has since been dewormed and vaccinated. He is incredibly active, loving and playful ! He is full of life and has a good temperament. He likes follows me everywhere and he is used to hanging out with other cats and adults alike.He likes to communicate through “love bites “ but has a friendly companion. Finally he is fully house trained. I are looking for someone who is Malaysian, no students. A person will continue his vaccinate program and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and good with other cats. As a friendly reminder ,keeping a cat is a commitment more than ten years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters,Galaxy hopes to find his perfect forever home . Kindly remember there is one Galaxy in the Galaxy ;) If you are interested in the little one, please do not hesitate to call/text, Asal ideally I would prefer if you could briefly tell me more about yourself in order to ensure that it's a match made in heaven!"

a2e22831f,"We adopted Edward as an adult 3-year old from a shelter in a pet fair six months ago. We have to give up Edward because we are expecting to move to a non-pet-friendly location in a few months time. He has been neutered, dewormed and vaccinated. Find us near Bandar Puchong Jaya. He is very tame, has a sweet temperament and likes to be brushed frequently. He particularly enjoys ear-washing with wet nappies. He is a strictly indoor cat to avoid diseases and accidents. He is very sensitive to kibble brand change and will vomit, so we advise you to stick to the brand we are using (Royal Canin™ Veterinarian Cat Food). I am sorry that a fee of will be charged to compensate edwards vaccination, medical and dental cost. However upon interview if the new owner is nice and can fulfill our requirement, we can consider free adoption. (Because a good owner is hard to find)"

cc8518f88,"Yota was found by my mom as this little kitten was stuck in her car (specifically, the engine compartment). We found out that he was there by his extremely vocal expressions. We called out to him and he crawled out onto my hand like a child reaching out to feel a mother's touch for the first time. He was named after the car which was a Toyota; Thus Yota. When we found him, he was so skinny and was crawling from parasites. Fast forward to a month later, he is an active kitten with a doggy best friend/big sister. He is very vocal, very active, and definitely very brave. At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over. This kitten is super cute and is a super sweet heart. If you adopt him into your family, I only have 2 conditions: 1) to love, take care, and provide him the freedom to be the active lil kitty he is; 2) to have him spayed by his 5th month of age. I wish to visit him again when he is in his 5th month to ensure that that is done. Thanks for reading to this point. Enjoy his cute pictures and I hope you get to enjoy his cute shenanigans."

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium.

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us.

Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people.

They are not exactly vaccinated, but I have given them heavy dose of antibiotic medication and antibiotic eye drops that do teh same thing the vaccines are suppose to do. They are both healthy and clean. However, before I find her, the gray tabby had a injury to her leg and was struggling to walk, which has healed now. However, she cant run as fast as other kittens, she is still fast and plays a lot. Please contact me if you can house these two kittens."

Personality She's friendly to humans, always needing their presence while awake. Loves attention. Very active and playful. History Kitten was found wandering near an LRT station and busy roads, thin and hungry. Now she is all bathed and clean. Medically, she is all fine other than being dehydrated & malnourished. Treated for diarrhea, all well now! Not yet spayed as she is still too young. Update: / As she suffered from extreme hunger previously, she has an obsession for food (goes crazy on sight of food). Now after 1+ month of training/therapy, she is much calmer, especially during feeding time. ^^ Update: / She gained g! (Now 2.05kg, only 1.3kg a month ago) Also, first vaccination given. Adoption Criteria Interested cat parent must agree to: 1. Spay her at 5-6 months old. 2. Keep her % free-roam indoors (not caged). 3. Attend to her health needs. 3. Treat her not as a pet, but as a member of the family. :) Also, please arrange to pick her up from our location, with own carrier ready. Play-dates can be arranged with no obligations. Because of her playful nature, extra effort is needed for homes with existing resident adult cats. Best for new cat owners! ^^"

a76cbec89,"Introducing foxy little Vitany! ♥ Female kitten, 8 weeks old. Silver / gray-coated with long fur and hazel eyes. ♥ A little diva! She acts classy 24/7 (constantly grooming herself and observing her surroundings). She's soft-mannered even during her most playful moods. A very mature girl! ♥ Quite vocal and will be the first to call out to you when she sees you. :) Vitany isn't too hyper and prefers to chill / lay back more than be in any active situation. ♥ Healthy, has been de-wormed (once), is still too young to be vaccinated. Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Vitany must be kept INDOORS at all times. - Adopters must SPAY her at the right age. - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you!"
94b6d93ea,"Chloe is a little white/cream/gray kitten found alone across a big main road at night, attracting the dogs of the entire neighbourhood who were all barking at her, especially our own rescue dog. When I got to her, she was shy but then warmed up quickly to friendly petting. From petting, she was partially covered in mange, her ears & face crusty and loosing fur. We took her in and gave her the medical attention needed to cure her of that nasty skin problem (also to avoid having all the other stray cats being infected as well). We suspect that she was dumped out by someone when her mange infection got worst. Few weeks later, after the last of the mange, Chloe's fur grew back and she is now a beautiful kitten growing normally. While our other rescue dog was still around, Chloe would sneak out to play with the dog too. Chloe's got a distinctive gray pattern on her left eye, and cream pattern on her right. A gray comet-like pattern on her white-cream head, and a beautiful fluffy tri-coloured tail of mostly gray tones. She has pale blue eyes, her fur is medium-long 80% white, paws pink with patches of dark gray/black. Chloe is used to being around people, loves to play on her own or with us and will not hesitate to ""tell"" you when she is hungry or in need of affectionate pets. If her usual toys won't keep her busy, she is also a curious kitten, who would love to follow us around just to see what we are up to. When we are away for a while, we'd come home to find her sitting by the gate, waiting for us. Eversince the viral cat flu, we have kept Chloe indoors all the way, to which she's got no problems. Chloe is fully vaccinated, dewormed, checked for fleas (clean!) and has recently been spayed. We would like to find Chloe to find a good home and family who will love to have this curious kitty & take care of her throughout. We have no doubt that Chloe will be a great little vocal companion to your life if you're looking for a furry friend to call your own. The reason for the adoption fees : 1. Chloe has been trained to use the litter box. 2. She recognises her name and will come to you when called. In order for her to listen to you, you must first gain her trust. 3. Chloe is fed on a mixed diet of premium kiblets and also specially prepared clean, real food (fish meat, chicken meat..etc) in order to allow her to absorb the best of nutrients and grow as a healthy cat. 4. Her lovely long fur is kept as clean as possible. 5. She is also used to car rides and being around people. 6. Chloe understands that she has her sleeping routine and play times. IMPORTANT: ADOPTION FEES WILL INCREASE ONCE SPAYED."

fc7b01af6,"We rescued her from a park in USJ2. It had been raining heavily nonstop when we discovered her by chance. She was very weak, starving, cold and most probably she barely had strength to move but when we tried to help her she responded with a domesticated attitude. We brought her home from the rain because we know she would die if we didn't help. when we brought her home she responded quite affectionate. However she wasn't very active cause she was still very tired and also had a slight limp. She looks like she is a american eskimo although I doubt she is a pure breed. When we found her she wasn't smelly even. when she was fully soaked. Which lead us to conclude that she hasn't been homeless for more than 5 days. We have asked around the neighbourhood to try to find the owner, however we feel that she was abandoned. Our situation dosnt allow us to permanently adopt her since we are students with a very limited income. As well as we are already caring for a beautiful dog who we rescued 3 years ago. She already seems well mannered and obeys when prompted to sit. The only negative we noticed is that she guards her food with an attitude. We think this is because she may had had to defend for her self when she was out on the street. Additionally she got along fine with our dog after the initial excitement of being introduced. Watsapp me if you're interested. Thanks"

d320b7121,"These 5 pups live in the bushes at the dead end road of Persiaran Putra Permai, near Section 10 of Putra Heights Subang Jaya. I believe people around this neighbourhood have been feeding them as they seem fit and healthy despite having no mother. They're an adorable bunch 😊 Now recognize cars and humans and associate us to food! 😁 Asking for kind souls out there to adopt one or all of them. This is one of the only ways to reduce strays besides spaying. I'm not able to foster or adopt any of them as I have a dog of my own and do not have time to care for them. These pups need a loving home. Come rescue them and give them a forever home 💜 Please contact me via whatsapp or email if you need more details. Hope to hear from you soon! Thank you"

The thought of just sending her back to the same street gives me a sinking feeling. I desperately need a good home for this cutie pie. She really is a good and well behaved cat.

cdab8ba8e,"Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)"

We didn't give much concern until they both fell from the ceiling, onto a built-in kitchen cabinet. We tamed them and fostered them for about 5 months. They are a couple of healthy and playful furry creatures. They would love some special treats from time to time."

bbb0a9ac2,"Trudy is a pure breed Dalmation and Lily is a mixed Dalmation. Trudy was abandoned at Sg. Long and kept appearing in front of my house. And Lily came to me during lunch at a coffee shop at Serdang with a very loving nature. Both has been with me for 3 weeks nurturing them to health and I cant keep them as I have 4 Rottweilers myself. Trudy and Lily has been great friends since then as they both know they were abandoned. No owner has claimed them till today after numerous effort. They have real great and obedient character and probably lived in-house. Anybody interested, please take both together as separation is inhuman for them now. Trust me, they are easy and independent and not naughty to be part of your family. They love sitting behind my truck for a ride everyday and they are so loving unconditionally. See and you will believe. Only true to the bone dog lovers are welcome to adopt them. God bless all."

08bfdc66f,We have had Chloe since she was a puppy. She has been lovingly cared for and loves children. There is not an ounce of aggressiveness in her. Loves walks and will sit and wait for her food. I have taken a job overseas and my wife is not able to care for her with my two kids and a mother with alzheimers. My two kids are also confirmed to have some allergies hence cannot play with her for long. Its sad for me to let her go but I am hoping a kind family looking for a beautiful loving dog would consider having Chloe in their home.

0d653b602,"I just found and caught a stray kitten at the back of my kitchen. It was raining heavily and the little kitten was all wet and hungry. I waited for hours to see any sign of the mother cat but there is none. So I believe that the little kitten is abandoned by the mother cat. Anyway, I managed to catch the little kitten and currently he/she is in the cage. I am still unable to hold the little kitten as he/she is still afraid of human contact. So, I am unable to know the little kitten's gender yet. My hunch is that the little kitten is a female :) I am looking for any potential adopter who is willing and kind enough to adopt this little kitten. The potential adopter has to be very patience with this little kitten as he/she is afraid of human. I believe that with tender loving care and patience, the little kitten will turn out to be a wonderful companion for the potential adopter. So, if any of the genuine adopter who is willing and able to care for this little kitten, please give me a call . Thank you. 1/3/16 Its been a week since I rescued this kitten and I found out that she's really a female and so I named her ABBIE. She's still wary of strangers but she's comfortable with me to the extend that she allows me to carry her on my lap and clip her nails. I hope that as time progresses, she will be more open to her surroundings and other people. 4/3/16 I think the kitten is male now that I have seen a little 'hump' near his rear end. So I am changing his name from Abbie to Aggie. 😊 9/3/16 Aggie is doing very well and quite playful. Hope he will get a new family soon."
c98d16315,"I found May (on 6th May ) outside a sundry shop, alone and tiny with no siblings or mum cat around. She was just 3 weeks old. She was totally approachable when I picked her up. Took her to vet for some fungal infection treatment on her back and limbs and dewormed (8th May). She has fully recovered from any skin infections (luckily it was mild) and her fur has fully grown back to shiny black! She eats with a very good appetite and has been fed daily with soft food and now with good set of teeth she's nibbling on kitten kibbles. Was only the length of a TV remote control and now more than doubled up that size! Very playful, super active and adorable kitty. She is roaming freely upstairs/downstairs and everywhere cos she is very disciplined when it comes to her toilet habit and so far has caused no mess. Very clever! She sleeps on my bed at night with my other big cat. Her name came about cos I found her quite late at night in the month of May. Ideally, to go with her lively and playful personality, adopter should already own a kitten or cat to keep her company and to wrestle with and chase around. Adopter who wants to have May must be a good pet owner who provides a loving home environment and healthcare complying to the following pet lover's requirements :- 1) Vaccinations 2) Neutering 3) Lots of TLC! Do text or email me. Thanks for viewing her profile. :D"

ec4ed9fe6,"Happy New Year folks. My name is Brownie. I was found severely undernourished and anemic and abandoned by my earlier owners. I was found in a carpark begging for food. I was subsequently rescued and nearly lost my life but I fought hard bcoz a I believed that I, like other lucky animals would find a family that loves me. The doctor advised against neutering me back then as I was too weak. But I now have a clean bill of health & live in a shelter but it is crammed up with many other dogs but I have no choice but to stay here until I find a home. I long to have nice walks and a happy life just like all other doggies. You will find a video of me here after I was brought home from the vet when I stayed with my pal Shalinee. They had to remove my fur cos I had tubes all over me. You will see in the video that I can ""talk"" too (much to the surprise of my rescuer!) :-)My fur is now all growning back and I'm a healthy and just waiting for a good home! My rescuer Shalinee has promised me she will find me a good home soon. Till then I wait here...."
8f15fc3d8,"To the kind person taking the time to read this, My name is Oreo and I'm just over one year old, male, pure Shih Tzu. I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom."

I am sorry that i cant bring them home or foster them neither, because i already have 5 dogs in my house, so these pups are now living in the bushes with their mother but i check on them everyday when im free. *actually the bushes is not a bad hiding place if they are good enough to stay in there all day but they are all a bit playful, so sometimes i might found them wandering outside the bushes. They are all male, all are very sweet, playful and super cute :)) But one of the black pupy with a wound on his forehead might need some medical treatment, since i cant take it to the vet,so i hope someone who with a big heart will adopt him and willing to take him to the vet. If anyone interested in adopt these puppies, please contact Mrs.Yap"

He will do a quick somersault and will sing you his own version of melodic ""meoww""... When you are sad, he will come to you and do his act of somersault and if you are lucky he will lick yur face. He will snuggle next to you when you sleep at night. He lurrve to eat...and he is adoringly ""big"" size ( I think he is 8 kilos)...so you can treat him like a baby and hug and cuddle him. He hates it when people whistle and if you do that, he will chase you around the house. His life is pretty balance, he likes to play and then sleep. If you like a companion, please adopt him and give him a good life. He is tough, rarely get sick (compared to kitten).

3029fcad6,"This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves. If you can't see the video on the mobile app, please visit If you are interested in adopting Morrison please call, sms or whatsapp to James (English only) at or Justin (English and Bahasa) at"

a7a94dd33,"Little Stacey was a stray kitten that had been wandering the streets for roughly a week. I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at. Please do not call!"

7975df564,"Ash is a people lover! She loves to follow you around wherever you go, and will always want to be in the same room as you. She loves it when you come home and she gets lots of attention and petting! She is a very playful cat and has a tonne of energy, but does seem to be calming down as she's growing up a little. She plays fetch, and we've also trained her to give paw when receiving treats! Her fur is sooo soft! She enjoys a good brush every now and then. And you can see she is a very pretty kitty who loves posing for pictures! Ash currently resides in a condo, and is quite happy to be kept indoors, but if you have some outside space she does like to have a run around and will always come home. In all honesty, she's not great with other cats. She has however, made a friend with a neighbours cat, but it did take some time.. She does love people though! Ash has a great personality and will be your best friend if you can provide a loving home for her. We are leaving at the end of October so just 2 weeks to find her a home. Please help!"

Blue kitten!' That's my fav color! its hard to find a blue kitten/cat nowadays unless they are British Short hair or Russian blue. the reason i want to let her go even i really2 want to keep her are: 1. am a student 2. am a wife 3. am a missy to my mom, shes a strokee 4. we got 6 cats already nothing much i know bout this BlueCHEESE ;). 24 hours with her just tell me she: 1. never meows 2. not scared when being bath 3. so manja, likes to purrr, likes to be hugg 4. most of her body covered with muscle, NO fat. so she is quite heavy 5. the coat is so pretty especially under the lights as the coat starts to look like Velvet. it shines and is really2 soft when touch 6. she has 2 big round cooper eyes 7. she got a wrinkle tail just like wrinkle fries ;) 8. she is SOLID BLUE but there is a small white patch under the tummy~ very low white The person that adopt her must SPAY her. its a must! i will ask from time to time as i do not want her to get into a wrong home. Adoption fee will be charged of RM10. whom ever is willing to pay for her then the person is willing to take care of her. (my experience for giving rescue kittens for free turns out not a happy ending for them ~ who will appreciate something for free?!) The person must live in Selangor or Kuala Lumpur only.

She's house trained and litter box trained She loves attention, rolling on the floor waiting to be tummy tickled. ! She has the sweetest meow and comes running when called by her name. However this all has to be earned through trust and a calm approach as she is a little timid and skittish since she was a rescue previously. So her new family should be preferably older children / adults , not small children . Also to be in a non cat household as she will tend to fend off other cats as her self defence. She is best kept indoors / fenced compound for her own protection . Do you have that special place for Gigi in your lives ? Please will you be her forever family."

e49b7c262,"♥ Male, 6 weeks old, brown seal lynx (Siamese) point with blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Louis was the tiniest runt of the litter whom we initially thought wouldn't survive! He had extra time and feeds from us and remarkably within a week, began blooming and catching up. He's still a midget today compared to his siblings! The most independent and inquisitive boy, he loves strokes and being shown around the house. He follows our feet everywhere! Loves sitting on our laps to watch things (whenever he chooses and not while he's busy playing, of course!). ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!"

One day, Happy followed my sister home and since then she comes to visit us occasionally. She's so smart that she knows the way back to the carwash after visited our place. My sister will bring her to shower every week. Unfortunately, last week we saw a Chinese man chasing Happy with a stick and threatening that he will poison Happy next time he sees her. We are totally shocked and worry for Happy's safety everyday and night now. Therefore we plan to create a profile at PetFinder.my to find her a forever home. At the mean time, she still hang around carwash which is very dangerous for her. We couldn't adopt Happy as we already have 2 dogs at home. Therefore, we looking for someone who can give Happy a good forever home. Happy has been vaccinated, spayed and dewormed and ready for adoption. Happy is smart, obedient, and likes to get attention from human :-) If you interested to get more info about Happy, please don't hesitate to call Wen Jing on. Thanks!"

I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me.

That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound. Doctor doubt that in his last treatment didn't clean his wound properly which caused a chance that there might be another maggot. It can be cure by taking oral medication as his previous maggot wound healed after few weeks time. Its a shame that owner abandon this beautiful dog and I couldn't handle 2 dogs because I have Jack Russell & small space plus my old man don't really like big dog.

I couldn't afford to keep him any more as my dogs cant get along with him and started to bark every night when I put him in the house. Once he is not in the house, he will join other strays and often come back with injuries. The worst part now I will be relocating to KL and unable to bring him along as I will be staying in a condo.

d1a2da8ef,"POSTED ON BEHALF OF OUR FRIEND MANDY. please kindly contact her directly if you wish to adopt: . TQ :) Pinky is one of the community cat that our friend-Mandy taking care of. Pinky lives at the back alley of her house and she feeds the group of cats daily. Pinky is a very very adorable, sweet, friendly, manja and tame cat. She loves dog and is very attached with one of the community dog - Bobby. Bobby is a sweet and friendly dog too and she gets along well with Pinky and the cats. Unfortunately past two weeks Pinky dissapeared for two days and she was found with severe injuries on her back side and it bleeds badly. It was diagnosed as dog bite wound and we believe that Pinky might got bite by other stray dogs around that area..she might think that dogs are all as friendly as Bobby and would play with her. Poor Pinky is still hospitalized in vet clinic. The vet are forced to cut off her long beautiful tail as the tissues and skin of the tail were damaged. We're worried that after she got back to the back alley she might got bite again as she's too friendly with dog. Pinky definitely deserves a very good and loving home. Please, adopt her if you're able to. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat him like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pinky ♥"

He was terrified of people but gradually warmed up to her after she fed him some food & he would wait outside her house at the same time every day for food. One day he didn't show up. When he finally showed up again, he had a large terrible wound on his neck. He was in so much pain and had tears in his eyes. She brought him to the vet and found out his wound had become infested with maggots. The vet treated him and she brought him home and nursed him back to health for over a month. The wound has now completely healed but unfortunately she is unable to keep him. He is estimated to be 10 years old but is still strong & healthy. We are unsure about his breed.

1528d2a61,"Found this lost Pomeranian in my neighborhood. He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?"

6da1ee245,"Sesame: He is loving & he knows he is your best pet, he sits next to me all the time as if saying that. :) Loves to give massages. Very affectionate chap. He doesn't complain alot, he just wants love, he doesn't care if you're going to hurt him. :(! Really! Great companion. He purrs when I'm near, or just by hanging out with me. Sesame is sometimes too brave, he likes to hang out with cats who aren't very easy with him around, wants to make friends he said, says he doesn't want to make enemies haha. Sesame's the runt, meaning he is smaller than average cats. Has a best buddy in the whole world, Peanuts. Peanuts: Follows wherever Sesame goes. Both Sesame & Peanuts are usually seen running around the field like in cartoons. Peanuts is very timid, craves to be around you, but just scared. I believe he had some bad past with humans. ONLY! when you close your eyes or pretend you're not looking at him, he'll come close, haha! Alot of times Peanuts squint his eyes during day time when there's sun, like as if he just came out from the cave, we just think he's hinting us for a pair of sunnies. Very CUTE meows, playful, he's the one who initiates all the games with Sesame. :) Just like Sesame, they like to hang out with bigger cats whether the other cats like it or not, says they want to make friends, not war. I'm looking for committed, serious, adopters. Adopters who will make sure they will be taken care of, ensure they will not run away to become stray again. They are both preferred to be given to the same adopter. Rescued by me, and I will be willing to get them vet-checked, neutered, and microchipped. Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again. Both of them must go together to the same adopter. Kitties and I will appreciate your help so much. Thanks for dropping by. :)!"

She absolutely loves to be petted but when your petting her she will make all sorts of funny and weird little chirping sounds. Also when petting her she will push her head into your side or into your lap rubbing and rubbing away as you pet her. It's just to cute. Also at feeding time it's pet me first then I'll eat my food. She is shy of new people and takes a while to warm up to strangers. Having said that once she knows you she will smoother you with cuteness. I know Callie is an older cat but just because she isn't under 6 months old doesn't mean anything. She is still as playful, loving and cute once you get to know her. If your interested in adopting Callie Call, SMS or Whatsapp either James (English only as I'm a Matsalleh) or Justin (English or BM) and we can arrange a meeting and see how it goes."

d596234fc,"Sweet little Angel was born without eyes. His owner although devastated never gave up on him. She provided everything she could so Angel can have a chance to live a normal life. Many would believe a dog born with such disabilities should be put to sleep. As the owner is working and fearing Angel may hurt herself, he is currently living in a cage 24 hours a day. The owner would like Angel to have a normal life running and playing around just like other dogs. We are now looking for a loving home for little Angel. It's our hope to find a owner who accept him with this disabilities and love him unconditionally so he can live life to the fullest. Our recommendation to potential adopters : a) Ask yourself the following questions : - Am I ready to be the owner of a blind dog. - Did I have the commitment needed? - Did I have the knowledge? - Did I have the right conditions in my home? - Most importantly, did I have the love in my heart to raise this dog? b) Allocate time so both yourself and Angel can understand each other. c) Provide time for training so Angel can recognise sounds. If you believe you can raise Angel and in return inspired others to care/raise blind puppies, please contact me for further details. “Blind Dogs See With Their Heart and Are Worth Loving”."

We at first thought that Picasso is a male (oops ;p we're not good in identifying sex of kittens) and so we gave a male name. But in fact Picasso really looked like a boy when she were young - she was aggressive when playing, always love to disturb the other cats & acts in a boyish way. Picasso was being rescued from roadside several months ago, we saw that there's a man stood there kept trying to kick Picasso away, she was just a tiny baby asking for foods that time! We sent her to vet for medical check up and found that she got real severe virus infection on stomach and she had diarrhea for over 2 weeks even after she took medications. Picasso is a big and healthy girl now and she started to really look like a girl..she's independent, smart, active and always love to play with her toys & friends. She loves to play different kind of toys and will never let you down when you get her a new toy - she will play it smartly in front of you. She do not like to be carried or hugged, but sometimes she will be very manja, she will just sit beside you and ask for your love and a pat on head. Please give a home to Picasso ♥"

I have been hand raising them to the best of my abilities and ensure they get 4 times a day food and milk to keep them happy and contented. For a month, I was bottle feeding all three to make sure they were well fed and watered. Blackie boy is the boisterous one among the Three musketeers.. He is friskier than the girls and loves to argue with me when i remove my slippers from his clutches. The only pup so far to have learned to bark.He also loves to sleep in the weirdest places-like in between the sliding door and the grille. If it fits, I sleeps! Brownie girl is the one with brown patches.. She is a fatty and loves to steal extra food from the other two.. so she is really a small piglet. But she learns fast and now sits on command, and has learnt that the living room is off limits with a simple NO. The largest of the three, and playful.Not bad for a tiny fella. Betty was named after Ugly Betty because she was the runt of the litter when newborn..Gave her special attention , nursed her from the bottle and kept her in my arms most of the time out of fear she may not make it through. After all that, she is truly a Betty and has bloomed into an adorable brown pup. She is the only one who does not bite me, but bites the others. Always with a cute sad face, she is my favourite of the lot. She loves to snuggle and prefers sleeping on my feet."

Mama Snowy is now adopted by a super nice woman who loves her to bits! Now Snowy Girl is looking for her forever home. Her wish is simple - she just wants someone to love her. Besides feeding her, playing w her, walking her, bathe her etc etc etc hahaaa Anyways, Snowy Girl is one happy playful puppy. She has a very shaggy fur on top but just like her mom, I think it is due to lack of nutrition coz those irresponsible people didn't feed them with good food. Heck, they only fed them once every alternate days!!!!! Oh, let's get back to the fur part. Her fur is quite shaggy on top and on her sides, it looks like its been trimmed nicely but that is how her fur grows. Very special indeed. She will grow to be medium size but quite leggy coz mama Snowy is quite leggy too. Snowy Girl is great w children and is full of love and smiles. If you have a household of other dogs, no worries, Snowy Girl gets along well w other dogs too. As long as your current fur-babies are friendly. If you think she is the one your family is looking for, give me a buzz. Only for serious adopter please. ADOPTED ON 24TH FEB TO DEON"

They take refuge in MPPP storeroom at the garden next to the community hall. One of them was spanked by someone according to a resident in the neighborhood. Sometimes, they take refuge in a drain hole in the pavement for fear of certain people. Now the Head of MPPP threatened he would rang the dog catchers here to remove the 2 puppies. My biggest fear is the rest of the strays will be caught and killed as well. I knew of this because I feed some strays (some with and some without license) in the area. I afraid these two puppies will be in danger as no one is willing to look after them let alone adopt them. Many vehicles pass by that street daily. I couldn't take the puppies as I live in a flat. Please help. __________________________________ Fosterer(s) or Adopter(s) urgently required to help these 2 lil' angels whose lives might be at stake. Neighbors and visitors to the park are complaining and its just a matter of time before MPPP come for this 2 sisters.

She and her three kittens need a great chance of living in caring homes. Pepper/Pebbles is a young first-time mother. She had her first litter of three healthy kittens 4 months ago. She loves people, is playful with people and other cats and is a good eater. She is independent but loves being petted, and purrs almost all the time! She also comes when she is called ""kitty"". We have been feeding her for some time, but we cannot keep her at home as we already have a dog. Pepper or Pebbles are just possible names for her, based on her unique colouring. You can choose a name for her once she is home with you. :)"

2b38b60d2,"Hi, My name is GLEE and I’m full of glee. That’s because when I was 3 months old, I fell into a drain and couldn’t get out. I was wet, dirty, miserable and scared. Then a kind lady came and hauled me out of the drain by the scruff of my neck, took me home and cleaned me up. She took me to the vet where I had to have a jab and some medication. I was saved from sure death! Now I’m neutred, have all my 3 vaccination jabs, am healthy and quite cute & pretty. I’m now about 6 months old, but it seems I won’t be a very big dog. My Mummy says I keep growing long rather than tall & big. It’s okay, I don’t mind being a smallish dog. It makes it easy for me to move around the place. Because I’ve been so lucky to be saved, I’m full of glee and energy. You should see me run – I’m fast! I love playing with soft toys. I can sit, roll, paw & shake, and fetch – well, most of the time, I can. I love car rides & bicycle rides. I used to sit in the bicycle basket, but now I’m getting too big for it! And I’m not a big eater, so I’m pretty low maintenance. Sadly my Mummy can’t keep me as she already has 4 other furkids. I wish I could stay with her but I can’t. So I hope to have a loving home to go to – where I can bring life, joy and glee to my new family. I hope we meet soon!"

He frequented my room and my neighbours' rooms and we cared for him as much as we could. Bubu has a wound near his mouth (the vet suspected it was from either an insect bite or a kitten fight) and we are currently treating him with antibiotic pills and dressings. All of us have graduated and are heading back to our hometowns. We would like to put Bubu up for adoption and would preferably look for an adopter who is: 1. Willing to treat his wound. (it's healing well and has dried up, just need to finish what is left of his antibiotic) 2. Must send him to his second injection for ear mites. 3. Must vaccine him. 4. Will preferably neuter him when he is of age. Bubu is affectionate (he's the purr-er type), playful, loving and beautiful (look at that fur! Its super soft as well). He has a bob tail which makes him even more special. 💙❤️ Please help share this around. We really want him to find someone who can love and care for him as much as (or better than) we did. If you are interested, please PM me or drop a comment below so I can reach out to you. The RM50 is to cover the medication cost of the treatment of the small wound near his whiskers (due to a kitten fight or an insect bite as mentioned by the vet) as well as a deposit to ensure that the cat is properly cared for as the abovementioned requirement."

Boy is now with a fosterer, ready for adoption. From past few days observation, he has a commendable behaviour (stays within his permissible area, no excessive barking, friendly nature).

7f6f8b365,"Boots, the formal wear kitty, was left abandoned outside my apartment block at about 3-weeks old. He was bottle-fed and socialised with human adults and children. Therefore, he gets along well with people including young children. He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt. I would inquire some details from you to understand your request for a pet."

86547ad6d,"Gabby is a beautiful sleek black puppy, estimated to be at 3 months old when she turned up. That was in March . Gabby is a lovely quiet dog that hardly barks. She loves to sit and watch us when we are gardening, or sit with us when we are at ease at the porch area. Our friends who visited us, remarked what a gentle soul Gabby is. The children had no problems playing with her as Gabby is not rough. We have recently had a BBQ party & we've received encouraging remarks that Gabby does not paw, bite or disturb any of the guests when they eat or drink. Gabby was lured to our neighborhood by an irresponsible family who was unable to care for her. We gave our home as Gabby's shelter, in order for Gabby to be safe from traffic, pedestrian abuse and harsh outdoor weather. This beautiful puppy is growing up in our compound and is turning out to be a gentle dog who loves long walks, tummy rubs, sitting with us during evenings, and lots of loving attention. We would like to find Gabby a forever home with a loving family as we are unable to be home at all times. Our job takes us on long outstation trips, and it makes it difficult for us to care for her in the long term. While we are not around, our neighbours are understanding enough to watch over her until we get back. Should anyone be interested in adopting this gentle black female pup, do contact me. I will reply as soon as I am able. FAQs Q : Is Gabby trained in anyway? A : Yes. Gabby's been sent for a Temperament Testing by a professional dog trainer. Gabby is also trained to know Basic Obedience commands (eg; Sit, Stay, Down...etc). Should Gabby's adoption be successful, the adopter will inherit her original file as proof of the training she has gone through, including the contacts of the dog trainer. Q : Will Gabby defecate / soil our porch area? A : No. We have trained her to understand that she is to do her business only while outside of the home. The adopter(s) must commit to walking Gabby twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening, everyday. Q : How long should these dog walks be? A : Anything from 15mins and above should do the trick. As long as Gabby gets her walks, gets to do her business, she will be a happy dog. And a happy dog makes a happy master :) Q : Is Gabby spayed, dewormed and generally checked for good health? A : Yes. Her medical records are all with our trusted vet. You will also be given her medical book for proof and as a reference to her visits to the vet. Q : Why the fees? A : We have taken pains to ensure that Gabby's properly vaccinated, dewormed, anti-flea/ticks, fed healthily, socialised (used to human interactions) and above all, trained for Basic Obedience commands to allow the adopter to have a much more easier time with the new pet. Our fees includes : 1. A sleeping cot 2. her favourite toys 3. medical book 4. file & certificate (certified by a pro trainer) 5. Walking leash & collar Q : I / We have never had a pet dog before, how will I know if I am doing the right thing? A : Don't worry. We will spend time with you and Gabby to teach you how to maintain her good habits and training in order for the transition to go smoothly. This will usually take about 2 to 3 hours. Should you have any questions, you may contact us for further advise as well. We will be happy to help you feel at ease with your newly adopted pet until you are ready to be on your own with Gabby. Temperament Testing & The Suitable Adopter : As Gabby has undergone a professional Temperament Test by our trusted dog trainer, we are delighted to share with you on the sort of suitable owner(s) she will be comfortable with. 1. If you are a family, your children should be at the age of 12 or above, and will not be afraid of dogs. All family members should also be responsible, take turns for practising & maintaining Gabby's training to ensure her obedience. 2. If you are a single person, you should be one of a stable routine & with a commitment to taking care of Gabby for the rest of her life. In return, you will have the most loyal and affectionate companion for life. 3. Gabby has been tested as a gentle dog with a friendly disposition. She is not aggressive nor is she territorial. She will love any attention you can give her, but she is also capable of being on her own most of the times as long as her basic needs (daily walks, food, drinks, play, training) are met. 4. Gabby is good on her own as the only dog in the household. If you have another dog, and would like to adopt Gabby as a companion, it would be advisable if your dog is also given a temperament test to determine if your dog is compatible with Gabby. Gabby is Not Good with aggressive and dominant dogs. Also note, if you wish to have Gabby as a companion to your existing dog, all her training could be for naught if your dog is not trained to listen to commands. Preferential treatment will render all of Gabby's training useless. 5. If you have a cat, have no fear! Gabby is friendly and docile towards felines of all kinds. In fact, Gabby is a cat-magnet in our neighbourhood. To date, she has ""rescued"" two kittens (one adopted, one in foster care) and is not aggressive towards cats, she just wants to play with them mostly. 6. Gabby has received the first Basic Obedience Training. Should you wish to pursue the next course, she is ready for the second stage : Intermediate Training (with more detailed & varied disciplinary commands). Requirements for adoption : As we have faced many set backs in regards to the adoption of our rescued pets, we would like for any potential adopters to meet these basic criterias before contacting us : 1. As an adopter, you should have your own landed property (not rental - neither owned by the company you work for nor renting under another name). This is to avoid any future problems such as re-homing the pet. 2. As an adopter, you should have a stable & existing job to provide for the adopted pet's every need. 3. Adopted pets should never ever be abandoned again if you feel incapable in providing for them. 4. As an adopter, you must realise that when you take on a pet, they will be an addition to your life in every aspect of every way. Adopting a pet is akin to adopting another family member. Love is not enough as all manner of care, responsibility & commitment to their happiness will be in your hands. If you have any doubts, please carefully reconsider all these points mentioned above, so that we may spare the pet (and us) of any unnecessary stress. We love all of our rescues and treat them like our own kids, but we also discipline them without favour. We'd like you to think of them as your own kids too."

cb867cac6,"Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : deworming + neutering + 3 vaccinations + microchip. We have to say that Jacker is a real smart boy - an abandoned Jack Russell who ran into our home compound one morning and tapped at our glass door to seek help! We took him in and found that he was dirty, having bad skin condition and emaciated. It was believed that he had been loitering on street for a long period. After sent him to vet clinic we found that he actually had microchip which showed the details of his 1st owner. His 1st owner told us that he've ""sold"" Jacker to one of his friend and after he contacted that friend who's the 2nd owner, he said Jacker actually ran out of the house and he don't want this dog anymore.(WE'RE EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HIM). The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good! Jacker is a completely different boy now after staying with us for few months, he's happy, friendly with every dogs, loves to have pat on head, loves to run and walk around when he's happy, not aggressive to strangers anymore and the skin condition is fully recovered. But please note that he will still keep a distance with stranger, get a bit frightened if you've have big action and he do urine marking in house. Interested to adopt? Kindly read our requirements: - Strictly NO tying/caging for long period - Agree to bring him for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat him like your own precious family members Please give a home to Jacker ♥"

2f73851f5,"My two little kittens are very healthy and like most kittens that age, very playful too. I found them about a month ago (8/7) when I was out on my run near my house and they just appeared out of nowhere from an abandoned house. They looked really scared and hungry and was as if pleading with me to help them; didn't want to let me go and kept following me. So I took them home and they have been under my care ever since. Unfortunately I cant keep them (as much as I would have loved to) as a family member is allergic. They're fed only with special cat food and they have very good appetite. I'm not sure of their exact age but I'm guessing they might probably be around 3-4 months and they're both female, and I presume they're siblings. I would prefer that they find a proper home and if possible, they stay together. Hate to see them separated! Please adopt them! You are most welcome to come over to visit them."

4b4bb2b0a,"A minor car accident brought about a trip to a car workshop which in turn caused the car owner to chance upon a 5 -month -old Shar Pei mixed puppy (male), now named Bear Bear. Seeing the deplorable condition the puppy is living in (lying around the floor with spilled engine oil, water container contaminated with all sorts of automobile oil and God knows if he's been fed properly), the car owner decided to probe a bit further into how he's been treated all this while. According to some folks around that area, Bear Bear used to have 3 other siblings but Bear Bear is the only one left as the other three were run down by cars which came to the workshop to get their cars fixed. Bear Bear has been brought to the vet for a checkup and blood test. Blood test results show that he's fighting some form of infection and is currently on a course of antibiotics. He has also got cherry eyes (the large red mass bulging out of the inner corner of his eyes. those are actually his own tear glands which popped out) . Anyone who knows about cherry eyes will know that it's a condition which is not visually appealing, but fairly common (especially in certain breeds, Shar Pei is one of them) . However it's actually benign (non life threatening) and can be corrected via surgery. Bear Bear is currently under observation and boarding at the vet's clinic. If all goes well, he would be vaccinated in a couple of days. Since the cherry eye condition is non life threatening, priority is given towards treating his infection. Bear Bear is very friendly towards humans and quiet (not whiny, and exudes a calm personality) We are currently appealing for anyone who can help foster him till he recovers from infection and ready for adoption. Kindly drop us a note at if you could foster Bear Bear whilst we work on getting him rehomed. Please contact Mun Ee for more info =) www.facebook.com/PawsMission"

4d8bc908b,These 5 adorable puppies are looking for good homes and families that can love them and treat them as part of the family. They need a lot of love and attention and must be well taken care off. Puppies cannot be caged or chained for long periods of time and also cannot be let out to roam on their own. Can only be taken on walks by owners on a leash. These pups must be spayed/neutered when they are 5 months old (we will make a house check).

He seeked my advice.He reclaimed them out at full fees, sorted out by the vets & came to us since april,. Jack was lucky & was adopted by a gentleman in June,. Jil stays on with the rest here growing up strongly to this handsome dog today. I think she has a chip on her shoulder for being left behind. Someone could change that merely by loving her & give her a home. Are you the one ? Otherwise, she is normal like all the dogs here maybe a bit apprehensive at times but suerly will join in when all other dogs crowd round us. She doesn't want to miss out either. More details, pls contact."

Sadly, their sibling passed away due to starvation. Since they are very young, i can't tell their gender by visual inspection. I have rescued them and they are currently in my safe hands. They are currently provided with food, water and shelter. All of the kittens are very healthy and playful. If they cannot find a home, they will be released in area with constant feeder when they are bigger. Hopefully they can find a home and don't end up as strays. Location is in Penang island/Ipoh. Transportation can be arranged. If you think you could be the one, please contact me via PM."

f4d945501,"Update as at 20 Feb : We believe this dog was abandoned in our neighbourhood. Big built like a Rottweiler, but a very gentle & lovable dog. Doesnt bark at all, but will whine & may howl a bit in excitement when he sees you. Gets along fine with other dogs & even cats. One of the few dogs i know that doesnt bark or chase cats when he sees one in close proximity. Appears to be in good health condition & has no signs of illness or injuries. Please consider adopting him & giving him a chance for a better life. He'd really make a good pet with his calm personality. Update as at 16 Jan : Dog is still around. He is so scared & just hides under the cars all the time. Refused food for many days & just started eating since yesterday. Definitely had an owner before. If you think you know his owner, please let them know that their dog misses home terribly. 5 Jan : Spotted this dog roaming around Bandar Utama (BU 11). Not sure if it is a stray that made its way here or a lost dog. Appears old but generally looks well taken care of, although very timid. Has a very unique stumpy tail. Hopefully it is not an abandoned dog!"

60875e5f0,"She was rescued from the back lane of my office 3 weeks ago. Skinny and dirty that time. She is not pretty like other kittens. My brother named her ET. She is like a bat without the 2 wings. But she is very intelligent, playful and likes to sit or sleep on your laps when you watch TV or at the dinning table. She will do many funny things that make you laugh. She walks and jumps like a jackle, run like a horse and sneak like a little monster. That is very obvious from her mischievous look and that pair of bright round eyes. You want fun companion, she is your right choice. But please keep her indoor. She likes to be close with people and she has well adapted to indoor life and environment. That is also to protect her from all the dangers outside. I believe that every life deserves a chance and love. Please lend your hand if you can. Not just the look, it is the character that makes her special."

203e2bd3c,"To reduce the number of strays in our society, I have learned from a kind-hearted lady who has a golden heart on how to rescue the puppies n rehome them and neuter the stray parents so that the population of strays will not grow. The lady and I went to rescue the puppies under the unwanted cars. They were wet when it is raining. They were suffered when it is sunny. They are so adorable although they are dirty n smelly under the unwanted cars. We have to 'dig & drag' them when they (10 of them) were under the cars. It's so grateful that they (7 of them) have been rescued. We have found the other 3 missing puppies yesterday night (13th April ). What a wonderful blessing! All (10) have been adopted on 18th May ! Thank you! Those who have adopted one or some even two, you are very kind hearted and you are a person with golden heart! Care and love for the one you have adopted and adopted the one you will love and care for.

ed97f6919,"Chance was rescued by my housemate from a hit and run near our house a few months ago. Our neighbours and friends chipped in for his treatment, and after a few months in the vet he's now up and about, and staying with us for the time being, until we find him a loving home. My housemates and I love him a lot, but unfortunately we won't be able to keep him as the three of us are not always home, and we aren't sure how long we'll be staying in this house. Chance is still young, the vet said at most 1.5 years. He is full of energy, but reasonably well behaved. A common friend of ours who is a dog-owner showed my housemates and I how to care for him. We take him for walks and/or runs daily - which is great because we get to exercise too! He's great company - generally listens and follows us when we walk, and does not bark at other dogs in houses we pass by. He's tries to make friends with cats and other dogs we meet on walks, but he's not always very lucky. Chance is a wonderful dog. As long as his energy is channeled regularly into positive activity, he will be very well behaved. He has misbehaved before, he chewed up my housemate's slippers and my bicycle pedals - but that's only because we forgot to take him out that day and he was bored out of his wits staying home alone. We haven't taught him any tricks, but he knows that whenever he sits down / calms down, good things may happen (i.e. go for walks, runs, gets more petting etc) - we try our best to encourage good behavior with treats or toys (tennis ball, stick, chewed up slipper etc), and we try our best to curb bad behavior either by ignoring it or staying away, or a pat on the bum with rolled up newspaper. We have about a quarter of a 20kg bag of dog food, treats, a leash, a chain, water and food bowl to give away as well. We just want Chance to find a loving home where he can be happy."

9862e5dfe,"Jackie is a female Belgian Shepherd. She is energetic and requires big space for her to run around. She is eager to please her owner and as a female dog, she is affectionate. She was staying with a friend who wanted a Belgian and she mixed well with my friend's female German Shepherd. Recently my friend's own German Shepherd delivered a puppy. It was then these two start fighting; maybe because of the GS protective instinct and Jackie's jealousy. I am not sure. I took jackie to my house but I cannot keep her long. I have 2 dogs currently. My house compound is not big for 3 dogs to roam around. If anyone would love to have a Belgian, please contact me. I hope that you are a dog lover and will look after her as your own. We can arrange a time for viewing at my place. You can contact me at . Thanks."

14398288b,"This cute lil puppy is up for adoption! I saw her at the vet & thought that she looks like BOLT. Trust me, she really looks like smaller-eyes-version Bolt. This lousy pic of her doesnt justify how cute she is! My friend had adopted her for nearly 2 months. He gave up on her due to her extremely submissive nature. She does well with other dogs but not so much with human. This is because she used to be a strayed puppy before someone picked her up & sent her to the vet. My friend is not a patient owner. He doesnt like the fact that she runs away everytime we go near her. She loves eating & will only come to you when you have food. Although she is a very submissive dog, she still greeted us when we came back from work. At the moment, she is a dog's dog & not so much of people's dog. She doesnt bark much unless she is playing with other dogs. She gets along very well with one of my mongrel dog. So i assume that she has no problem getting along with other dogs. Please bear in mind that she is not a people's dog as she was a strayed dog previously. I m looking for a very patient & loving owner who is willing to spend time with her & take care of her so that she is not reluctant of interacting with human being. Pls do not give up on her due to her submissive nature. I believe that she will eventually gain more confidence & be a really good companaion!"

f2ff942f1,"Life span: 10 to 15 years Medical cost: RM to RM per year(for the basic yearly vaccination and check-up WHEN they are young, it may cost more when they get older and if they become sick). It could cost you about RM more for heartworm prevention and tick prevention. Maintenance cost: depending on what you feed them, it usually cost LESS than RM per month. Supervision: High only for puppy especially during teething period as it would chew anything in-sight. NO HITTING on the mouth!it is too close to the nose which is extremely sensitive. You can spank it’s buttock gently . Please allow me to gather some information for my own peace of mind that you can be a good owner. 1)What is your residential type and where? 2)Do you have any experience in handling dogs? For how long and is the dog still with you? 3)Are there other dog(s) in your house? How many and what are their gender? 4)Are there other family member(s) and who would be the main care taker? 5)Puppies need to be toilet trained. They do not make a mess on purpose, but due to the lack of guidance. Would you try to train the puppy without traumatizing it? 6)Are you willing to spay/neuter the dog? (one time cost between RM to RM) 7)Your reason(s) for keeping dog(s)."

bb2808ff8,"I almost knocked down this kitten yesterday afternoon while driving a car (22-Nov-). I took it and brought this cute kitten to a nearby animal clinic to be examined right away. The doctor confirmed it was a male kitten, between the ages of two months, and after examination, the doctor confirmed it was in healthy condition. Cat flea medication was given. In good faith, our family is unable to care for this kitten because it was too small, moreover, my wife and I work on long day, while the children are in college. This kitten needs someone who can give greater attention to him. And we already have a big male cat and a rabbit. We fear we can not provide love and care to this kitten. By the way I name him ""TWENITU"", because I met him on the / :-) So, I appeal to anyone who is willing to take care of TWENITU to contact me. In the meantime, I will make sure it is in good health and the doctor advised me to bring it back to the clinic after a week for the vaccine etc. Thank you."
19f5a15ab,"Mimi was found in KL roaming around. She now lives in a parking lot in KL taken care by the parking attendants and feeder at the area. Regular feeders make sure she is properly fed and healthy. Mimi is still a puppy, healthy and playful. She is growing up fast as she is fed proper food daily. She has medium length fur and is cream colored. She resembled a lab when she was younger. When we took her to the clinic for spaying on .15, the Dr. and assistant complimented her beauty and said that she looks like a golden retriever. Many people admired her sweet nature. Mimi has been vaccinated twice and dewormed twice as a puppy by a kind vet who liaised with the rescuer/feeder. Her next shot is due in a years time. Mimi is in danger if DBKL comes to their duty. We hope that she will find her adopter soon, so she can start to grow up to bond with them at an early age. If you like what you see in the pictures posted, do consider giving her a good home to live and eliminate her from danger. Rescuers dont ask for much, but only pray for a good home for their rescued ones."
