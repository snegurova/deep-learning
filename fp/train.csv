Her body is fine, it is usually her neck that is affected. I have brought to several vets multiple times but as it is not an actual sickness, they cannot help. Her wounds are self-inflicted. Unfortunately, I am not an experienced cat owner and am not able to take care of her as well as I should be. So I am looking for a cat-lover and someone who is able and willing to take care of her. Please refer to the photos to see an example of her wound.",1

b6fbfa344,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",2

6134ae21d,"We live in KL and are looking for some advice to find a new loving home for our Dog, Wagyu a 3 year old Shiba Inu pure breed. My wife is giving birth to our first child in January and the reason we want to find a new home is that we do not want a dog around a small baby. Based on looks … for sure he is the number 1 in the world But overall he is more of a wild animal than a Lab / Beagle etc … and as a result we always need to treat him with respect / care. He needs a garden / space to run around in. We read a lot about the breed before we bought him. Everything that is on the internet about the breed (Shiba Inu) is % true. Their character, how they act, that they need to be on a leash … everything. We have had him fixed, so this calmed him down a lot. He is a healthy dog, been well looked after and in good health with a full passport / vaccinations etc. If you have anyone that would like to meet Wagyu, let us know and we can arrange any time. Above all else, we want to know that he has gone to a family that will love him as much as we have. It is a very hard decision to put Wagyu up for adoption. Thank you, Scott Photos of Wagyu",3

The lady shoo-ed me away at first, but I think my howling and whining changed her mind. According to the vet, I am a healthy, female, and I'm young too, between 1-2 yrs old. I've been vaccinated (horrible experience!) and dewormed. I love playing tug-of-war and I look forward to walks in the evening. I like to make friends too, with both the canine and feline communities. But the cats don't seem to like me, I've received countless slaps from them when I say hi. How strange. The lady says I'm cute and affectionate, and I'd do anything for a nice belly rub. Adopt me, pretty please?",4
a9bfec3ba,"Nottie & Choomi are both rescues. Nottie was a dorm kitty in Nottingham University. I adopted her when she was 5 mths old. She wandered into the campus and stayed with the students for a while, a learned kitty and a graduate I would like to say. So, she can be a bit of a snob sometimes. But she loves pats and scratches and paper balls. Her meow will melt even the hardest heart. She would be almost 3 years old. I call her my Zen kitty. Always calm, cool and collected. Choomi was rescued when she was a tiny 3 weeks old and sickly. Slept on my chest for weeks. But she's a survivor. She's now almost 2, healthy, active, loving, cheeky and chatty. I always talk to her and she'll answer back. They are both house cats, loves basking in the sun on the balcony or windows and much loved. Both are spayed, chipped and vaccinated. They have had their rabies and leukaemia shots as well. I have to put them up for adoption due to unforeseen circumstances and it's a decision which is causing me and my son great pain.

Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at.",2

823d5bd7e,"Inky and his siblings were abandoned at our housing area. He is a healthy, active kitten. He is litter tray trained. He has been given his first vaccine. We are looking for someone to adopt him as we have too many cats. It would be great if the person can also adopt his sibling - Pinky, although this is not a must. We prefer to give him up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter him and also take him for regular vet checks. He needs to be kept indoors, as He is very young and would not know how to survive outdoor. Being a new environment, he might also runaway if kept outdoors. He is very good with our cats. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet. Only for serious adopters.",2

The most vocal of her siblings, avid talker. She's an escape artist who learned her way out of the pen quickly, enjoys exploring everything. We can't stress this enough, you will see how happy she is when romping about. Bravest yet when it comes to covering large spaces. She is a wonderful sight when resting, angelic faced and loves strokes. ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Donatella must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement.

002278114,"16 September update: Aura and Solar both adopted by Liz of Bandar Utama! Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",1

They were found skinny and a little raggedy in a fishy styrofoam box by Brickfields Monorail station, but after a good cleaning, some healthy feeding, and a trip to the vet to thoroughly remove any extra ""guests"" they had, they're proving to be two lively, curious bundles of joy. (See the videos section to see what I mean!) Suit (Soot) is an adventurous girl who loves to climb and loves to eat even more, while Tie is a little more polite gentleman who loves it when he's being gently cleaned or combed. They are approximately just under 4 weeks old and currently being weaned on soft kitten food. No adoption fee required, and I'm willing to sponsor any vaccinations/deworming/spaying and neutering procedures they might need as they grow, up to RM!

With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period. She is such a fighter against all odds despite the serious injury at such an early tender age of her life. She is growing up to be a beautiful and loving girl. Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13).

a906ff5f5,"I've had Angel for a year now, and know all Angel's good traits as below: 1) Once Angel trusts you, she will be a loving and loyal pet, who will greet you VERY excitedly when you come home (even if gone for 5 minutes!). Be warned that she is a licker :) 2) She protectively guards the house, barking when people are near. So she makes a great guard dog/doorbell. 3) She does NOT bark all the time and annoy the neighbours 4) She is intelligent, e.g. she knew how to use my dog potty mat without any training, and will obey if you tell her to sit instead of jumping on you when you're eating. 5) She's not hyperactive but active enough that you can jog with her if you want a jogging companion. 6) Fully vaccinated, dewormed and spayed with no known health problems. However she was previously abandoned and possibly abused by her previous owner, resulting in some occasional aggression due to insecurity and fear. While she is friendly with most people and male dogs, she is occasionally (not always) aggressive when around other FEMALE DOGS, and in SMALL CONFINED SPACES or TIED UP for too long BY HERSELF. Meaning under these conditions, she might growl, snarl and in the case of female dogs, potentially fight with the other dog, but not all the time as she is usually playful with other females once she is used to them. She does NOT have this problem with male dogs and she also does NOT bite people, including children, unless you intentionally agitate her (in which case, you shouldn't be adopting a dog). So if you're an experienced dog owner with an open heart and willing to give an occasionally temperamental dog a loving home, please read on. Interested adopters should: - Be experienced in keeping dogs, as well as able to keep calm and handle somewhat aggressive dogs. Angel can easily be approached by a person she trusts and touched to calm her down as I do this often. - Preferably already have a mature and friendly MALE dog to keep her company, especially if you are frequently away. No female dog owners, for the reasons stated above. I have a male dog whom Angel gets along with perfectly fine. - Preferably have garden/porch for her to run in when you are out. Although she is used to living in a house, she will get agitated if you leave her in the house alone. She is fine if left by herself in a garden whole day or if someone or another dog is with her in the house. I'm giving Angel up not because I cannot stand her behaviour, but because I wish to do more dog rescue work which involves me temporarily keeping unfamiliar dogs, including nursing mothers, at my house, and I do not want her attacking the female dogs. Also because I may plan to move overseas in a few years and will take all my dogs, but Angel will be extremely stressed if in a plane and quarantine for a long period. Thanks for reading, and if interested to give Angel a wonderful forever home, please call Carol at. Located in Subang Jaya.",4

c9cab5e67,"Introducing sweet little Jamaica! ♥ Female kitten, almost 6 weeks old. Has a diluted-calico (blue instead of black) medium-hair coat (will develop) with beautiful hazel eyes. ♥ Absolutely loving girl! Stroke her, carry her, hold her, hug her, give her kisses, anything, she won't protest. :) Jamaica bonds closely to the people who pay her the most attention. ♥ Jamaica's very vocal despite her teeny-tiny voice. Has a lot to say especially when spoken to! She explores her space and can even jump onto significantly high places despite her size - her favorite being her human's lap. ♥ She is a follower as well and tags along behind feet - very purry and gives us massages with her little feet. She will need lots of attenion as she seeks comfort with people often. ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble independantly. She has been dewormed (still too young to be vaccinated) and is in good health. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Jamaica must be kept % indoors for her own safety. Apartments should be cat-safe. ○ Spaying is compulsory (when she's older). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire - this is for any cat's long term welfare. Please drop me an email or text (WhatsApp) if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you!",1

bce0e17b9,"A couple weeks ago two kittens were found by my aunt's colleague in her car engine compartment. She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart. If interested, please e-mail me or SMS/Whatsapp me at. Please do not call!",2

As I love her i have strict conditions for the adopter. main adoption conditions are: 1) The adopter must be a real DOG LOVER 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get updates . 3) The adopter must exercise dog by taking him out for walks once a day or once in two days. 4) The adopter must be financially willing to provide for a high-maintenance dog especially premium food and regular grooming. The adopter must provide the basic preventive dog care such as the yearly vaccination and monthly spot-on application to prevent ticks/fleas/heartworms. 5) The dog must be fed with proper premium dog dry food and no wet food or food scraps. 6) She must be kept indoors due to her small size. If you're interested to adopt , please whatsapp/viber or send an email to my email address () and please introduce yourself by your basic information and past history of keeping pets , your house conditions ,etc . Any juvenile-type e-mails without providing the necessary details (ie tell me about yourself, your place and dog ownership experience) required will be not be replied. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by msg first. My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for them. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about potential adopter before making the decision. ***STRICTLY NO AGENT AND NO PET DEALERS*** Thanks.",1

7b1c82382,"I'm helping my vet out here, Dr Joanne of Philos Vet Clinic found these munchkins running on the NKVE freeway. She got them out of there and into the clinic. They’re about 3 ½ months old as well, and have been dewormed, de-ticked and have had 1 vaccination already. They’re currently housed in Philos Vet Clinic awaiting their future family. There will not be any adoption fee for these munchkins, and Dr Joanna offered to have them spayed and vaccinated (2 more dosages). So you can bring them home now, and when its time, bring them back to Philos, and the procedure will be done free of charge. Enkay and VeeYee have short but fluffy coats. We’re not sure if they are littermates, but they seem to be quite close, and will meow for the other if separated. Veeyee has conjunctivitis and is currently being treated for it. She has light grey coat while Enkay has brownish coat with a white breast. They’ll grow to be very handsome looking cats. To enquire, give Philos a call at (don't watsapp), or simply pop by anytime to view the munchkins. You can also contact me about it. :)",1

6c399cb06,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime.",1

Good thing I was able to separate them or she would have been a goner. Still a cheerful pup despite the incident but fearful at times.

9a591a8d9,"This is Jasper.I have had him for almost 3 years now. The reason I am giving him up for adoption is because the place I live in is very unsuitable for him. There are too many stray cats in my area and Jasper has come home too many times after being involved in serious cat fights. I have had to take him to the vet hospital so many times as an emergency case because of his fighting. I tried to keep him indoors and not letting him go out, but he got very depressed and wasn't interested in anything anymore. He loves to go out and sit in the sun and to roll in the grass. However, where I live, the place is very dangerous and there are hardly any fields for him to run and play at. I am looking for someone who seriously loves and understands cats. It is very important that the area you live in should have a field/park as close to the house as possible, or hopefully, your housing area is safe and clean. He needs to go out into the field and play, otherwise he gets very cranky if you only lock him indoors. Jasper is a very loving cat, very chubby and fat. He's almost 6 kg. He loves people and loves to be petted. Also, he's a vegetarian. He only eats cat biscuits, nothing else. Not chicken, fish, prawn, etc. He's also trained to use the cat litter. But he has a weak immune system, and he's prone to getting a flu often. So if you are interested in Jasper, you also need to know that he needs a booster every week. It's a small bottle (about RM49) and it can last a few months. You only need to put 7ml of it in his mouth once a week, so that Jasper doesn't get the flu. I am only looking for serious adopters who will take very good care of Jasper and will love him very, very much. He's a very special and a beautiful cat. If you are interested, please email me at or you can send me a FB message at",3

da34209ec,"♥ Coco, 8 weeks old, tortie-lynx point with blotches of gray / cream / white and blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Coco is a sweet-pea and has a true inherited Ragdoll nature where she goes limp if carried! She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to ""help"" us). ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",2

04bad9310,"He's called Yoda because when I found him hiding above a tire under the car engine in the 1Utama car park on 27 May , he was just skin and bones and all big ears and eyes. The name proved to be very apt because he turns out to have tons of attitude, spirit and fortitude. He may be a scrawny under nourished little kitty, but he remains healthy, strong, curious and brave. And from the first day itself, he understands that he's been saved and shows his gratitude by giving head bonks, purrs and belly rolls. Therefore, he is suitable for a person who wants a cat with intelligence and a strong personality with an instinct to protect what he considers as his. Some important info: * His weight on 27 May when he was found was grams. * De-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 27 May. * Vaccination was done on 2 June . Another de-worming was given. On this date, his weight was grams. * Next vaccination is 2 July . The adopter has to make sure his 2nd vaccination is given on time. * Litter box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name and the reason why you want to adopt. Yoda is a very special kitty, so I would inquire some details from you first.",1
34d5748f7,"Hello cat lovers! We am looking for anyone who can take care of these two beautiful and active cats. We found these cats in our front yard (we put cat food in front yard for strays), about two weeks ago. These poor kittens had their whiskers cut (Apparently there are people who believe that cutting cat's whiskers will make them unable to come back - poor these kittens! That is just animal cruelty!) When we found them, they were so hungry and so slim their backbone shows! They are now perfectly healthy and active. We already brought them to the vet clinic and have them dewormed and deflea and the doctor said they were 1 and a half months old. They are still too young for vaccination though. These two loves to play and very spoiled. They are litter-trained and can already eat dry food. One of them is male - white coloured with black spots on his head and black tail. The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail. They need to be resheltered as we already have 4 cats they get in a fight so much we have to put these two in the cage at all times to avoid injuries. We hope to find a new home for them for the kittens well being. Location : Serdang",2

a63f6c6a1,"Update 27 Oct : on Saturday 25 Oct , Boy went to Central Park, Desa Park City and he was having a lot of fun running and walking around the lake for about 2 hours. He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him. May God bless you.",3

Have to pick them up as earlier there were 4 kitties which I thought that it would be better for the mama cat to take care before I take but it was too late, 2 disappeared (propably died too), one was thrown down from a high floor and the other was tortured by a 10 yr old boy. He poked both its eyes and twisted its neck before throwing it down also. Poor little kitten must be hell for him.",1

He's a happy and lovable dog. Although generally very docile and obedient, he's an active and playful puppy that would always look forward to feeding time and play time He has made friends with another stray puppy that is under my care and they frequently run around the compound chasing each other and keeping themselves occupied for hours through the day. On chilly rainy days or cool humid nights, they share a cozy cage together to huddle up close or to sleep. He has a very good appetite and is always chewing on rawhide. He's a loyal companion, always gentle, yet watchful and observant.

They were rescued at a month plus and currently being fostered by a kind lady who owns another couple of rescued dogs. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made the fosterer's two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life. An adoption fee of RM will be required for spaying and neutering to prevent them to have babies in future. We do not want those puppies to end up in street again.

2af9db4dc,三隻可愛的貓需要愛貓人士的領養哦~ 喵喵是haroro和lily的母親。她很照顧她們兩個。從她身上，我瞭解到貓的母愛也是很偉大的。希望有人能終結她流浪的命運，給她一個家。 Haroro很調皮，你想抓她的時候，她會亂跑亂跳，但是玩夠了，她就會乖乖的呆在你身邊。Lily是個吃貨，而且還很膽小，她會一直待在一個地方不敢亂跑，很可愛。一直到現在這麽大了還是很眷戀媽媽和姐姐。 希望想要領養較小貓咪的人能夠考慮她們。 領養條件： 你必須有經濟能力，如果沒有必須得到父母的同意。 不能隨便給她們吃不好的貓糧或人類的食物。 不能關在籠子里養，衹能開放式的養在家裏！ 領養的第一天答應帶他們去打預防針。 真的是愛貓人士。 非誠勿擾，謝謝。 流浪動物的命運坎坷，你有信心能給他們幸福的家，幸福的人生，請聯絡我。,4

In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more.(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family.",2

They were adopted twice but they have had unsuitable adopters. After that they were moved to a fosterer's house, who is no longer available to keep them. They both feel they are not loved or wanted. They may look big in size, but are very sweet and loving. They are also able to follow simple commands, sit, down, etc and are in the midst of learning more. It would be great if they can be adopted together but they are independent enough to be separated. So interest in either are welcome. I am not the fosterer or the rescuer, but am helping my friend to get them adopted. I personally agree that they can be very sweet and are quite trainable if you spend some time with them.

269192694,"I have 1 domestic long hair cat, (1 year female, neutered) and her 4 short hair multicolor kittens (2 month mixed gender), as well as a cute black/grey medium hair kitten (2 month) for adoption. The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but it´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But it’s not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them. If you have any problems in keeping them, you can return them to us immediately, no questions asked. If it is important to you, the cats stay in a ""halal"" household.

419d296e7,"Cooper and his two sisters were rescued from a parking lot in Ara Damansara early this year. He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information. Serious inquiries only please. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with dogs is much appreciated.",3

This weight is taken 1 1/2 hour ago before i create this post. For adopter information :- 1) I'm not selling pet - Both of them was given to me by a friend from New Zealand. Yes, im not buying it but the cost from New Zealand to Sarawak is more than Eur1k. 2)Why i charged for both of them? if someone couldn't afford to pay adoption fee then how my cat can live in good environment with new owner? 3)I will show you all certification about both of them. I will hold all documentation about cert/import document/certification document etc. unless you show me how are they for 3-4 months. If i can see they in good hand then i will release all document to new owner. If you ask why? I think everyone know the answer well. Now lets talk about reason : 1)My wife having our 2nd baby and always complaining about not feeling well. Including vomitting when smelling thier dry foods. 2)I tried to get relative's to handle them but most of them have aggressives guard and indoor dogs. 3)My cat never caged. Only in carrier or veterinary hospital for checkup. Thats the reason i couldn't send them to boarding till my wife give birth. That's it.. For Muslim's adopter do not feel worried about my cat. They tooked dry food only. Suppliment also halal product. Wet food once a week gm each of them is plain fresh fish without any ingredient or even fish bone. Giving together all 4 tiers cat tree/bed/pet food/grooming equiptment/shampoo/dry cleaner shampoo/accessories etc. Pet food can last 2-3 months. Warning : No seperate adoption. If not willing to take both then forget it i wont letgo seperately. Thanks..",4

d8715d47e,"Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : spaying + 3 vaccinations. GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",4

29a08292f,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",2

I love everything! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we found Maple and her sister, Caramel in a basket in front of the 99 speed mart on a wet rainy night (blame the monsoon season). Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them. With Miu miu's help, these babies managed to grow into the bright and spunky puppies they are today! So if you're interested in adopting puppies that were raised by a cat, contact us!

I insist that whoever adopts them will spay them when the time comes and gets all the proper vaccinations and deworms them regularly. If possible, I would also like the adopter to take both.

Living outside the food court, Coffee and his brother Milo are often being bullied and beaten by the food court employee. They were abandoned there when they were pups, despite not getting enough food, they are always being beaten by the food court staff, they stayed on, as that is the only place they know. Young Coffee is extremely trusting and friendly like any pups should. Coffee is neutered, vaccinated, deticked and dewormed. However, due to shortage of place to keep them, Coffee and his brother Milo had to be released to the food court after visit to the vet. The heavy traffic and unfriendly human around is not a safe place for these sweet pups. We pray for the kind person to give this poor kid a real home before it's too late... If you are able to help by adopting or fostering, please contact Sandy via whatsapp / sms / phone The brothers are very close, while single adoption are welcome, if you can keep both of them would be much appreciated :) and here's Coffee's brother - Milo",3
0658597c9,"MOST SUITABLE owner will be selected. Because adoption fee is FREE and Marschia really needs special care, I have to select the best owner for her. There's no other reason why I'm strict with the selection than to avoid neglection to occur by her new owner. _____________________________________________________________ Marschia is a very vain cat with blue marbled eyes. Her parents were burmilla + domestic long hair. So that makes her a mixture of both. Personality wise Marschia's an OK cat... means she's not that manja, unless you give her lots of attention.. she's also grouchy sometimes... anyway she's till a nice cat if you treat her properly. I'm looking for owners who can keep her in the house, or let her have her freedom inside/outside the house compound ONLY. Marschia is litter trained... Marschia is Maya's only daughter. She has a son named coco puff but he's not opened for adoption. Thank you. Marschia's owner(s)",1

She came to us two years ago when she was roaming the street, having been abandoned or thrown out by her previous owner. She then decided to adopt us (yep - she waited in front of our gate every day until we took her in) and has since been the reason for many laughs. Even though she must have had bad experiences before she is very trusting and curious and I have never seen her aggressive towards people. She will always try to stay close to one of us. Although she is very alert she rarely barks and is generally very calm. She has learned some commands but needs some additional training to listen really well. Rosie would be ideal for a family with kids as she is very gentle and patient. She is currently living inside the house as well as outside in the garden, so please no small cages or chain for her. Even though we leave the dogs alone during the days she has never chewed or destroyed anything. I hope a new family can give her the life and love she deserves.

When Dennis (her rescuer) and I rescued her she had an enlarged spleen that indicated some sort of infection. She was treat by Dr Tan at Vetenary Essential Services at Kota Damansara. After she recovered, she was spayed and has been given her vaccination. On the 21st of September she was diagnosed with TVT with slight vaginal bleeding. It was not prominent earlier and showed up much later. Since then, she is being treated for it and has already been given her first injecfion (she has 3 more to go). Mimi has a good temperament with a laid-back behaviour. She basically just lazes around and is very calm around people. She is also quiet and hardly barks (ive not heard her bark yet).

a878a916e,"We found this amazing little guy abandoned in the streets of Mont Kiara at about 4 weeks old, alone and injured. We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks! I'm happy to send more pictures/videos and even set up a time for you to meet him.",2

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

My skull was cracked & I suffered temporarily blindness due to the sudden effect on my nerves. It also affects my movements. The pain was unbearable! Imagine the concussion you had during migraine? What I encountered is worst than migraine, as my skull cracked & I am still a baby. Despite being given a jab to reduce the swollen, I cant bare the pain & cried in pain the whole night. The next day I was admitted for observation & medical attention. I was at the vet for around 2 weeks. Its by miracle that I'm still alive today, thanks to Dr Sibi who attended to me & all the other doctors & assistants at the vet who take turns to care for me. I'm a survivor!

Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding ♥",1

Muffin is the one with a furry head. Both Muffin and Cookie are very friendly and healthy as good neighbors always feed them with nutritious pet food, bath them weekly and play with them every day. Also they are dewormed, vaccinated and spayed/neutered. However, some heartless people around this area are constantly hitting them with stick,helmet and even steel chain.Today another waste picker threatened to kill them with mouse powder. The feeder is unable to take care of them anymore. It is best to find them a proper home so that they won't have to wander around the street in future. Your little help means a lot to them.

9a1715a97,"We are relocating to Australia and due to strict animal importation laws, we might not be able to take one of our cats with us. We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)",2

She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare.

302d37427,"Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adopter must update my foster mummy on my progress and allow a home visit.",1

I did try to talk to his owner, apparently she won't take my advice seriously. Jack Jack feds on human ta pau food. Three times a week. That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack. Oh yes, he responds to this name given by me. And yes, he has no name with his previous owner.

250f59089,"Gus was found in my neighborhood in mid-January . He was weak, wheezing and flea-infested. The vet says that he was quite small for his age, and not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Ultrasound scans show that his intestines have very thick lining, explaining why he was small (malabsorption) and had loose stool (maldigestion). After a few rounds of medication and gastro-intestinal kibbles, he's much better now. His coat is smooth and shinny. He has good appetite and his poop is normal now. He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail. The vet says that there might be some Maine Coon background as Gus has an oblong build. He's a loving cat with good temperament. He loves to sleep on my hand/arm while I work on the computer. He recognize people and can be wary of strangers. But warms up to people after some playtime together. He spends his days eating, sleeping and playing in my office. His recent favorite toy is a piece of palm leaf [see video: Gus vs Leaf]. --> WHAT IS GUS LOOKING FOR",2

3e2cc2690,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

She waits all day long for me to return home to take her for a walk. Unfortunately, I will be leaving Malaysia in 6 months and I cannot bring her back with me.

She was rescued by Cherishlife Home in August and adopted by her current family in October. She was found wandering the streets so everyone is pretty convinced she was abandoned. Unfortunately, because of this her history is unknown. The vet is unsure of her exact age but puts her between 6-7 years old. When we took Sophie home she was underweight and her eyes were a leaky mess. She had obviously not been loved or cared for in quite some time. She's now healthy and looking for a true furever home. Sophie's sweet & affectionate towards people and other dogs but would be happiest to be the only female dog in the house.

Two male neutered cats (coz i want to do my part in reducing strays in this world) currently at around 2.5 yrs old. Very lovable & playful. Raised as indoor cats (litter trained) but loves the occasional outdoors after a few minutes of sniffing around to get familiar with the surroundings. The short-tailed brown cat is named Sleepwalker & shortened to Sleepy & shortened again to Cheepee :) Cheepee loves belly-rubs, playing chase with his toy mouse & gives this short cute acknowledgement when you call him while he's napping. The long-tailed black cat is named Munch Munch & shortened to Munchee & interchangeably called Wer-Wer (pronounced something similar to 'wear') coz he tends to meow that way :) Munchee loves the outdoors & chasing lizards & giving head-butts & loves taking a nap on my legs. Both also loves playing chase with a feather-stick, going round & round & round. I'm looking for cat-lovers who can give them a loving home. Their basic cat stuff & toys will be passed along as well.

eda8eecc6,"Thank God for sending a lovely family that fits the descrption of our ideal fosterer, and would do what i listed below for the dogs! Timtams are now part of a loving family of parents +3kids+a maid and loving the wonderful corner house with grass in the compound! ----- TimTams (one is Tim, one is Tam)- to make it easier to call them! Potential adopters should be able to commit to: 1) walking the dogs 2x a day (or keep them in secured bungalow/semi-d/corner house with vast area to roam, as they love running and playing) 2) spend time playing with them (they're still quite young, and will whine for attention unless given regular affection-time with keeper) 3) give fresh water daily & proper food (they eat kibbles) 4) keep shoes in proper shoe cabinet cos one of them is still displaying puppy behaviour of chewing shoes or moving them around (unless he gets adequate exercise and attention) They appear to be brothers, and was roaming Ara Damansara area when found. Plus points about these dogs: 1) trainable: know how to sit/shakehand/come 2) loves children and will play with kids - excellent FAMILY PETs! 3) chase cats (but don't attack them) 4) will bark at strangers - good alert dogs! 5) friendly to keeper and friends 6) great with older folks because of gentle nature - makes excellent FAMIlY PETs! 7) get along with other dogs, even male dogs (possibly because not fully sexually mature and also very gentle + playful in nature), so can join family with existing dogs. NOTE: Will only entertain genuine adopters who'd take either one or both dogs as family pets. They get along well with other dogs. Tim once ran up to an Alsation in my neighbourhood and I thought he'd be minced meat, but they got along fine! Tam was badly injured (possibly by other dogs) when he was rescued, so he'd need responsible owners who'd make sure he's kept in a safe environment.",3
de97498e6,"I love Guana alot. Guana Description: 1) She is very active, she likes to run alot. So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately.

He loves to cuddle and get pet tons, take walks and sit in the park listening to the birds, and playing fetch with people. He is house trained and neutered so there are no messes or embarrassing moments with new lady friends :) He is trained to either go outside for a walk twice a day or pee indoors on a Pet Pad (like a flat diaper on the floor), whichever you get him accostumed to doing. He is very easy to bathe, walk and feed. All this dog needs, besides food twice a day and a bath once a week, is love. If you love him he will love you and be happy. He does not need too much attention or medical care, just love. I am an American teacher in KL. I adopted my Shit Zu, Marley, two years ago from a friend who moved away from KL.

32ac38a9f,"Rex was an abandoned and we believe abused dog that was rescued by a client from an area close to her workplace. The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

3f3962d65,"Breed: Husky Age: 2 Weight: 15.6kg She was having very bad skin condition when we found her. When we brought her to the vet, she was diagnosed with having demodex due to her low immunity. After about 9 weeks of treatment, her furs grew and she has became more active. She loves running and playing with other dogs though at times she's a little over-friendly and hyper. A week ago, the fur on her paws started to shed and demodex attack is back. We spoke to the vet about it and vet says that it's most probably her immunity that is causing the growth of the demodex. She has been with the fosterer for 3 months but the fosterer has to move out from her current place and shift to another place where the new landlord doesn't allow any pets. Currently she is in the clinic under the care of vet but the boarding fee is an issue to us. We are looking for experienced adopter (preferably owned a Husky before) where: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging 2. Must be able to provide medical needs, yearly vaccination etc 3. Allow visits & follow ups (send me pictures & videos of Brandy during initial stage of adoption) 4.

edb154f1c,"Hey there, Our Lucy has just given birth to 8 milklings. 4 browns and 4 blacks. All of them seem to be healthy and growing very steadily. Following their mother's size, they are likely to grow into medium sized dogs. Their mother is a very attached, affectionate, and agile dog. I suspect that they may grow into great companion and guard dogs if you care for them. At present their eyes are still shut but they seem to be able to sense what is in front of them. I had so much difficulties trying to take their photos as they would ""shy away"" from where the camera pointed at them. Their markings look like they are most likely going to have solid colours, some socks, some ridgeback-like lines, some tuxedo chests, maybe one cream too.

c0858dfca,"A Malay neighbour asked for my help to rehome Murphy and she has be raising him for 2 months after her children rescued him. - He has a long tail and no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - He was dewormed by a vet on 2 September . - He was vaccinated on 2 September at a cost of RM59. - He was Frontline-sprayed on 2 September to protect him against fleas for about a month. - His weight is 1.47 kg as at 2 September . - I'm feeding him with premium dry cat kibbles (Evo - Turkey & Chicken Formula). - He can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using premium scoopable cat litter (Ever Clean). - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - His behaviour: He's domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Murphy, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first.",2

He was picked up at a local mamak restaurant, where he had been dumped by a family.

A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy.

Just give her a toy & she can play it 1 whole day by herself. She is under toilet training (potty) now & could be let go at anytime. *RM adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery done.

9e1caf559,"Hi everyone! My name is Pinky and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09. We're so pleased!",2

Distemper is potentially fatal in puppies with weak immune system, but can survive if their immune system is improved with good food and supplements.

However, it's been almost half a year that she's staying with us now but have not been able to get along well with the the kitties at home (she's quite active and playful but they are not, which makes the environment quite stressful sometimes for all of them).

7bda94ad0,"When I search through the cats on petfinder for adoption, my heart sank as most cats are cuter, younger and prettier than Ninja. Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him. Anyone who likes to find out more about Ninja may drop me messages on whatsapp at (Michelle)",4

a90da3a12,Sweet Gigi is so sweet that she makes friend fast - with human or dog. And she is not very vocal. She doesnt bark much. It will be good for those looking for a quiet companion and not a guard dog. So please do not expect Gigi to be fierce. Those who are interested to adopt will need to know that my sister wishes to keep in touch w the successful adopter on Gigi's updates. This is her normal request on all the dogs she rescued which adopted by others. Please contact Caryn. She is based in OUG but will send Gigi to those who are unable to see or pick her up.

3ee594f5a,"Hi everyone! My name is Theo and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My auntie Rebecca rescued me on monday 15 June . She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE 24 June - Theo has learned how to do his business in the litter box and started eating canned kitten food on his own yesterday!!",1

Blue is looking for a new home as his owner is traveling overseas (and taking his four rescue doggies with him). Blues Story: Blue is a very special kitty, and has found a very special place in my heart. He was found at a road side by a friend of mine, a very frail grams of pure will and determination! :) He was in such a state, covered in flees and paint (Blue paint, hence his name!) :) We have no idea how he came to get that way... my friend took him in and patiently and lovingly nursed him back to full health, Blue just didn't give up all the way! :) I adopted him, and now he's here with Missy and Max and he's just full of life, and loves to play and wrestle with Max! Missy is getting used to him to! No matter how much Missy hissed and spat at him, he just didn't give up there either, and persisted to try and make friends with her, it's all working out too, and they now can sniff each other without too much fuss! :)",4

The are always chained and get tangled up to a point where they cannot move. They are very friendly and sweet dogs and bonding with other people and dogs should come easily, as it did with me. Very energetic, intelligent (more so than my purebreed) and friendly with children and people. They will be easy to train but are very social and need to be around people or dogs alot.

e2b5913e7,"Meet Ms.Faithful, Ms. Faithful is a stray dog living in my housing area. Faithful and I have always been pretty closed as if we have known each others for a long time. As if we are born to be bonded. In fact, our first meeting was just three weeks ago. Everytime we meet, she would wave her tail excitedly as if shes trying to tell me “Hi! I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?!

923a03e90,"Please send an sms before calling if possible because I might not pick up your calls when I'm busy and might not call back unknown missed calls. Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",2

b4d0c60b6,"YOU can CONTACT the couple at if you are interested. MORE pictures available here: THE HISTORY: They were basically abandoned by their previous owner who left them behind when he moved out. The couple that moved in was left to look after them and has slowly been finding homes for the cats over the last year. There were 28 to begin with and there are 18 left. The last 18 NEED HOMES URGENTLY as the couple is no longer able to care for them. Due to some personal issues, and a new baby then need to move out. None of the local pet associations are willing to take them on so it is once again left up to concerned caring citizens to help out and lend a hand. THIS is an URGENT call for HELP! These cats need homes within the NEXT TWO WEEKS. Please invite ALL your friends to this event which shall be on going until all the cats are rehomed. Invite them ALL because even if they themselves do not want a cat, they may know someone who knows someone who does. THANKS FOR CARING! soraya",4

0164a9cfb,"Heydee was found wandering aimlessly on the street like a lonely, hungry and thirsty dog 2 weeks ago. Her wounded and rugged condition caught my attention- flea, lice and tick infested, with lots of bleeding & weeping wounds all over her body. Despite her painful condition, she was a very happy, cheerful, energetic, positive attitude doggy, the tail wagging all the time. So I brought her to the vet, dewormed, deflead, deticked, vaccinated, spayed. I even shaved all her hair to allow the wounds to heal and so the new beautiful hair could start to grow. She's a beautiful, strong, healthy happy puppy now. Heydee is a very smart alert dog, she learned how to ""sit"" on command in just a few minutes. She's very adorable, cheerful, happy-go-lucky, well-disciplined. I already have 4 big dogs, I can no longer afford to foster her. Please find a home for this adorable chap. She's now staying in a temporary shelter, after 2 weeks I would have no place for her, with no choice but to return her to the streets. Please help, find her a home. She's very friendly to everyone, a good companion & perhaps guard dog too. She's 15kg. If you love dogs and are looking for a companion dog, to walk with you, exercise with you, play with you, cheer you up, destress, turn your mood around - she's the one for you.

She was very skinny when she first came to us but she is healthy and has gained weight now. She's an intelligent cat that goes to you when you call her. If you're interested to adopt blanket don't hesitate to contact me at,4

Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo. Please note that we love our dog very much, and therefore, no breeders will be entertained. Preferably KL families only as we want to check future adoptive families' homes to ensure that it is right for our dear Hugo. Thanks :)",2

b984a461b,"Introducing Noel! This girl has a beautiful white coat with bright orange patches. Oh, and hazel green eyes to die for! Rescued on a rainy Christmas afternoon at a street junction in Petaling (Friday). After a brief moment of petting, the darling decided simply to 'adopt' us, she kept tagging along wherever we went. (It's like she knew it HAD to be me, that i'd finally give in to such temptations and take her with me). I can be such a kitty magnet at times... This lady is extremely sweet and manja. I don't think she's had much attention from anyone during her life on the streets. Thus, i'd prefer it if she's able to go to a new home where she'd have other kitts to play around with...either that or lots and LOTS of human attention :] She's able to take solids already (currently on RC Kitten diet) and is clever with the litterbox. If you would like to give this girl a good, loving home, please contact me or drop me an e-mail. Details on your past experiences with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you!",2

a1093437e,"Josie was rescued from my mechanic’s workshop because she is at high risk of being run over by vehicles there, stepped on by the people coming and going there, plus exposed to heavy metals, chemical fumes and heavy machinery. My mechanic was the one who first rescued her though, so I thought I’d help him find her a good home as I'm usually not at home. In addition, I am partially allergic to pet dander, which is a skin rash condition that flares up if exposure is prolonged. I would love to give her hugs because she is an intelligent and loving baby but my condition requires me to limit physical contact. Josie is also already weaned, now eating Iskhan (holistic Korean) kitten kibbles and also wet canned food. Playful, smart, affectionate, sweet natured and active, she will be ready for adoption once she is dewormed and vaccinated. Potential adopters may contact me at (voice calls only) or at via SMS and whatsapp. I’m located in KL but meet-ups can be arranged in most PJ, KL and Melaka city areas. All pre-adoption/fostering costs will be borne by myself. Pre-adoption/Fostering costs covered include : Deworming, vaccination, Advocate, de-flea/de-ticking and flu medication. Spaying costs would be shared with the adopter. UPDATES + ADDITIONAL INFO AS OF 13 SEPT : - Toilet-trained in under 15 mins! - Not picky with food.

You will not be entertained. Please read the following T&Cs for adoption before you contact us: Terms and Conditions: 1. Tell us why you would be the perfect adopter, and your experience with dogs, if you have any dogs currently, if you live in a landed property, and if everyone in the family is in agreement to adopt the puppies. 2.

Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9.

MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable!

e18cc7a60,"[ Update on Oct ] ""October"" is still available for adoption. He needs a loving home without any adult male cats. He is an alpha cat and dominates other adult male cats. However he adores litters and cares for them lovingly, playing the role of daddy and mummy cat simultaneously. He brought up 3 siblings when I rescued them age 1 month old. Now they are 5 months old and ready for adoption. ""October"" nurse them and thanks to ""October"" these 3 siblings survive without a mummy. ********************************************* I picked up October 09 (as u can see thats the time I picked him)at a market place at Sri Gombak. This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

Location Perak Slim River 在年，我看到一个毛茸茸的孩子有皮肤问题和脱毛，然后我决定帮助毛孩给一些药和食物它吃。两周后的毛孩子的皮肤看起来越来越好毛也长出了95％了。每天早上街上开店的店主怕它会影响客人会尝试赶毛孩走，可怜的毛孩子无处可去有时还站在马路中间，或在车底下隐藏和休息。毛孩子是新来这个镇，这里有其他的流浪狗我很担心他们会打架和担心有1天市议会会来赶他们杀了他。毛孩子很乖很好也很爱玩，在这之前他是很怕接近陌生人他会逃离，我尝试用食物来接近他喂他试图去摸他。然后他慢慢接受我让我摸他，现在每天晚上当他听到熟悉的车声音他会跑过来，他知道这时候是他的晚餐和幸福的时刻了。我会和他玩几分钟他很高兴周围跑来跑去，当我们要离开时他会追在我们后面之后停下来看着我们直到我们离开。因为我家现在有5个流浪狗了，如果不是我会给他一个温暖的家。他现在真的需要一个温暖的家，如果你有兴趣请让我知道联络我。 谢谢 Location Perak Slim River",4

He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place.

1f34d9c73,"Miko was found all alone lying on a busy roadside when she was just a newborn baby. Her eyes and ears were still closed, her umbilical cord was still attached to her tiny belly, and she had no teeth. She needed to be hand-reared and bottle-fed constantly. After 7 and a half weeks of TLC she is now weaned, knows how to use a litter-box, and can run and play. Miko is very very attached to people and gets along well with them because she was raised by humans :) She is extremely affectionate and follows me around everywhere i go. She likes to be near people all the time. Miko is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Miko are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and spaying to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and spaying at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Miko started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Miko to be loved her whole life :)",3

8079e3a1c,"20 April update: MinPin is on trial adoption MinPin was found on a busy road and is being put up for adoption since no one claimed her. She's now believed to be abandoned due to her cataract. Due to her early cataract which is probably genetically inherited, she can only see shadows from her right eye although she has good vision from her left eye. This would caused her to panic and start protecting herself by snapping if there's any sudden movement. However, when she knows you, get used to your voice, she will be as adorable as a kitten. In addition, due to her cataract problem and her not being well socialized, she will start barking whenever there's dogs or cats near her so she may not be suitable to multi-pet homes or has to be monitored when around other pets. As she was likely abandoned by her owner and probably had to fight for food while on the streets, she is still protective over her food while she's eating, so it's best not to disturb her when there's food in front of her. Behavior: - She's toilet trained, will only pee and poo outside the house. - She can walk off leash, she will follow the clapping sound when you want her to follow. - healthy and fit, loves to be with humans. - Her personality and attitude is more suitable for a family that do not have other pets but the adopting family has to be patient when dealing with MinPin and she will eventually listen and be an extreme cute girl when she gets to know you better. The adopter should be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the dog and forgo the need for physical visits to check on her. By the way, MinPin was featured in Star newspaper on 16 February under the Dog Talk column. Thank you, Ellen Whyte! If you're interested to adopt her, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and tell me about yourself especially your dog ownership experience and do expect an interview.",3

79db05f63,">^.^< Kayama >^.^< If you are looking for a kitten full of love and play then this is the companion for you! We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!",2

Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him.

d9f692e74,"""I was a breeder cat before being surrendered to my current foster mummy. I was unwanted because I was not good at taking care of my kittens and my very first litter of kittens all perished. I was never vaccinated nor taken out of my home and spent most of my life in a cage. Despite this, I have proven myself to be very trusting under foster care. I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter. Please drop me a text or WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home. Thank you!",2

9a770c49a,"According to the Vet, Coco (d dog) is 7 years old. He was abused by his previous owner by tying him up, day and night; providing very little food, water and shelter. When Coco's testicles became inflammed (not sure how that came about), Coco's prev.owner kicked him out of the house. Coco remained faithful and waited outside the prev.owner's house although with great pain. The prev.owner would then use a cane to whip him and use pesticides to spray onto his inflammed region. My friend saw and rescused the dog. My friend then approached me to foster Coco (to nurse him back to health). My hubby agreed with the condition that Coco to be adopted after he is well and fit as Hubby is not an animal lover. Coco has been with us for slightly over 1 month now. Not only has Coco recovered fully; I have neutered Coco as well as dewormed and vaccinated him. I would like to find a good, loving and nurturing home for Coco as I have promised my hubby earlier on. Coco is a protective but not agressive dog. He is a good family dog and esp loves children. He doesnt bark unncessarily. He is fun loving, active and loveable. Coco deserves a second chance and I know he is now ready to be love and love his new found family. I am not very familiar of his past but I do know that he is a very loyal dog to us.",4

01ac09f2a,"Hi cute-looking human out there, I was rescued by my saviour when I was 3 months old. I was sick, and found at a wet market. My eyes were full of discharge, and my nose was blocked. A good market stall seller rescued me, and sent me to a vet. As my saviour has dog, he could not keep me until I am well. He has found me a fosterer, and here, I am given a chance to live until I am healthy. I am very healthy now, I need a permanent home, I don't want to be back on street or market. Please give me a permanent and loving home, and I promise you will not regret this decision. I can be a very good companion, and need very little maintenance. Please call/whatsapp/sms or to adopt me. Our adoption rules are as follow: 1. Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",3

Owner of gym told us that they're forced to release them to street when they grow older. All babies are afraid of strangers but after some times they will be friendly with you. We really really hope to get them a home ASAP before the owner release them out to street..they definitely deserve a good home :( Interested to adopt?

Due to his accident, he's very scared of cars. Currently resting at an office, where he needs a fosterer asap. Other info : Very timid, likes to go hiding behind bushes and flower pots while laying still. Probably that's how he survived so long by himself. He's going to the vet tonight- will update this profile tomorrow when we have more info on his leg. Updated 23rd Oct : The vet said he dislocated his hip but to determine the damage an x-ray is needed. However we need to make him put on a bit more weight before the vet agree to sedate him. He got dewormed, and vet also said to wait 2 weeks before his first vaccination. One of his baby tooth is loose and going to fall out as the vet noticed.

7390b70c5,"Introducing pretty little Emmie! -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Female puppy, 7 months old, has a sleek black & tan coat with floppy ears. ♥ Emmie (just like her already adopted mates Prada and Louis) had a rough start as a puppy. She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance. Thank you!",3

They are part of the 5 kittens born at my place, so it would be preferable if they are adopted with at least one of his brothers/sister, as below: Saffron: Sesame: Sundae: The main difference between Sago and Sugar is their character. Sago is the gung-ho adventurous kitten. He is always the first kitten to pop out of the cage when it's opened. And the first kitten to explore new areas. Sugar will usually stay behind at familiar spots and is more timid. Sometimes Sugar can be identified by his softer tail with a slight curl at the end.

A frisky little one who loves to play with lightweight things - foam sponge balls, ping-pong, bubble wrap etc. Enjoys both fresh and dry food. Toilet trained. I do bathe her and use flea medicine. She's an adorable dear, lies at your feet when hungry and may nibble your toes. I'm heartbroken to give her up but I doubt that I can afford quality and necessary care plus I have asthmatic allergies. I'm not expecting any payment but I hope she can be taken into a nice home and showered with love. If possible, neuter/spay her when the time comes. I'm also willing to pass on the items/tools/catfood I currently have to the next owner. As long as you're willing to take up the responsibility of a new furry companion :)",2

0cd614218,"♥ Male, 6 weeks old, white with cream / brown blotches and blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Markus is a wild child! A very playful and energetic boy. A sprinter, loves toys and exploring new things. He enjoys being carried around the house to see things or even outside, however of course he chooses when this happens (not a cuddle-cat while he's playing around). When he's tired or sleeping though - he will seek our arms and is the sweetest thing! He's a nipper and tester of everything so energetic homes or true cat-people will be his best match. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!",2

f0d254628,"Ling Ling (short for Darling) is the most affectionate cat you can have. She sits on your lap in the evenings and place her paw gently on your face, claws retracted (serious!), purring away. Very playful and inquisitive, with big bright eyes and expressive meows whenever you talk to her, Ling Ling makes a great and funny companion. She is easy to pick up as she lets you do it, not like some cats. And she loves the adventure of being underneath the blanket! She also loves climbing into any box you may open. Give her a plastic bag and she'll have a whole night of fun. She's also toilet trained. However, Long Ling is not perfect. She is afraid of strangers at first, but warms up gradually and then becomes affectionate after some time. We have rescued other cats before and she doesn't like them. We think that she might learn to like them if we let those other cats stay longer, but so far we haven't tried. Ling Ling also likes to pull out toilet rolls and tissue paper, so beware!",3

Unfortunately they're very allergic to cats so i'm sweet pea's foster mum now. While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them.

83d15cf4d,"Introducing dashing little Maksim! ♥ Male kitten, 12 weeks old. Blue-coated tuxedo with thick fur and hazel eyes. ♥ Rambunctious & frisky boy! LOVES to play & run about (needs toys, kitty companions or some kind of constant stimulation). Active households are his perfect cup of tea! Maksim is extremely vocal and knows how to talk (meow) back when spoken to. :) ♥ Maksim LOVES being carried over his people's shoulders (he stays put like a parrot and simply enjoys the view he gets). Maksim will also run right over to your lap whenever he's spooked by something (still doesn't stop him from exploring every nook and cranny he can find!) ♥ This boy can be a little demanding when he taps into his manja-moods (asking for cheek-rubs and strokes while he snoozes off). Mind you he has a VERY loud purr! ♥ Maksim is healthy, has been de-wormed (once) and given Frontline (flea medication). Already clever with the litter-box and able to eat kibbles independently. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** - Whenever alone, Maksim tries to ""play"" with our fingers during stroking, and sometimes nips. This is only play-biting and a simple ""shh!"" makes him stop immediately. :) He is a very smart kitten and for this reason, experienced cat owners are preferred. - Maksim must be kept INDOORS at all times and NEUTERED at the right age (adopters who already practice neutering their cats preferred). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy. Thank you!",2

Our adopted pet started showing signs of being pregnant and gave birth to four heart-achingly cute and healthy puppies on5th August. Caring for 5 pets at home is quite a task for us, so we are hoping if you are really keen on committing into caring for a pet, do give him or his 2 other brothers a thought.

Boy is friendly and allows us and other strangers to pat his head. He also follows my husband around when he walks our own dog. We can't keep him because, as mentioned earlier, we already have a dog and our house compound is not adequate to house 2 dogs. Boy has a ruddy bark, bright eyes, golden-brown fur and a calm but alert disposition. Another rescuer agrees with me that Boy is an abandoned dog. I think that he will make a good watch dog,or a companion to an experienced dog-lover/ owner. He may not be a good guard dog because he is not fierce.

Long-coated Coon/DLH mix with pretty hazel eyes. ♦ Guinevere was rescued while she was trying to cross a busy street. She was very weak at the time:- dehydrated, had fleas, flu and also diarrhea. She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs.

She's curious about our other cats as well as our dogs! ♦ Do not be fooled by her size, she's a bundle of energy and loves loves LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all.

She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe. Maddie doesn't like to be alone so it would be great if she could be adopted by someone with another friendly dog or someone that has time to spend at home. At the moment i am paper-training her because I am not home enough to expect her to be completely housebroken. I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at.

bdb6ebb91,"Miu Ciu, Small Black, Teleng & Orengy are about 4 months old today. They were born on 9th Dec . They will be up for adoption. My heart breaks to release them all. Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home. I only prefer cat lover, if possible want them to be adopted as pair. Because I love to see them both together and they are very attached to each other.",2

So i gave him some food and pet the head abit. when i was about to leave, this fella glued on my feet! I ever thought of making him a companion for my cat, Lucas. But, my boy doesn't want to share my love with others. He wants to be the only feline child. Since my boy rejected so furiously, i have no choice but put him in the guest room toilet (glad that we decided to take him in as heavy rain with thunder storm started soon enough) - about 1.5kg - all white with a small yellow patch on forehead, and a fluffy yellow stripes long tail. - he learnt to use litter box as soon as I put him in one. very smart. - super manja and love to hug on human's feet. - love to be cuddled very much. - will knead and purr when being cuddled. - very active and playful. love all sorts of cat toys. - good appetite. - well behaved while bathing. - love to play with water.",3

f45b98b4f,"[For Adoption] 8years' old female (spayed) Labrador is looking for a good home. Princess is healthy with blood test done, e canis test and heartworm test done. Princess has been through a lot and was abandoned and starved for a few days before rescued by other rescuers. She was later re-homed to someone who passed her to someone else when moving away. The adopter tied her up 24/7 and bred her. They refused to spay her. Finally, after much persuasion, the irresponsible adopter returned them and handed over to us to foster. Princess has been spayed. She is a good watch dog as well. She is friendly, active and playful, calm and gentle. If you are interested to adopt, please read the questions below and answer them. Those who do not read will not receive reply from us. There will not be any adoption fee for Princess and her prior medical expenses are sponsored by us. 1. Describe the environment you are willing to provide them with 2. Any experience handling dogs? 3. Is your family supportive of the adoption? 4. What diet do you intend to feed them? 5. How much time can you spend with them daily? 6. Are you agreeable to home visit and sending regular updates to us? Thank you for choosing to adopt. Please send us a message to answer the questions.

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",2

I am currently fostering at Selangor. - NO students. Priority for locals. (Unless you can convince me, if you are an international) - Prefer working adults to support food, health and etc expenses. -** Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. (I MAY ask for the deposit of first year vaccination and will return once you have vaccinated the kitten with proof. I may or may not. However you are required to inquire at your preferred clinic and inform me on the vaccination amount. (Please understand this is only to assure she will be in good hands, and caring owners will not hesitate) - Please spay/neuter when she is 6 months old (December /January ) as this will make her healthier and happier. - Please avoid outdoors as she may want to go out often, get into cat fights, catch diseases and etc. Be with her if you want to let her out. ....................................................................................................

If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" .................................................................................................... ......................ABOUT KITTEN......................... - She was rescued by one of the owners of Happie n Jovie ( Centrepoint BU ). She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten. Thanks for your time to read through! ....I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine.",3

61d4dc56b,"California showed up at my front porch in June but my cat-owning neighbours do not know who she belongs to so she's likely dumped. As a result, I decided to spay her and rehome her since she's still young. - She has no tail deformity unlike most other domestic cats. - She was dewormed by a vet on 20 June . - She has been applied with Revolution on 5 August to protect her against ticks, fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms for a month. - Her weight is 4.15 kg as at 7 August , a gain of 0.65kg since 10 July . - I'm feeding her with premium dry cat kibbles. - She can drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the cat to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage her health and shorten her life. - She's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using pine litter which is good for her (& human's) health and the environment. - Her poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as her overall health. - She has been spayed on 28 June at a cost of RM. - She has been vaccinated on 10 July at a cost of RM50. - Booster vaccination and deworming on 7 August at a cost of RM68. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate her yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM50 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only partially cover the RM spaying, vaccination & deworming costs which I'm subsidising. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt California, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate?

c96f9d3a8,"Simba is a 1 year old friendly male tabby. He is very affectionate, obedient and docile. (He dosen't bite despite being subjected to his first bath after I took him home!) Simba loves to be petted and wouldn't hesitate coming up to you for some attention. Simba was a stray cat that approached me in a parking lot. I noticed he was sneezing and coughing and brought him to the vet where he was diagnosed with a common cold. Simba is currently on medication and is scheduled for his vaccination and to be neutered soon. He is the most adorable and trusting cat I have ever came across and I wouldn't have hesitated to have adopt him myself, but sadly is unable to due to financial and time constraints. Simba is looking for a forever home and strongly prefers to be kept indoors all the time. He also hopes his new parents would follow up on his subsequent vaccinations, not to mention give him lots of love. Simba is litter-trained and eats both dry and wet food. Pet carrier, litter box, water bowl and scratching board included. Do contact me on whatsapp if you're interested!",2

95708d284,"Tom was rescued a few weeks ago. He was wandering around outside my friend's office looking for scraps to eat. The scrawny little tyke was skin and bones. He pulled at my friend's heartstrings and she bundled him up in a box to bring to me for fostering. He had a fungal infection and this had made him lose a lot of hair. After weeks of treatment most of it has grown back and he now has a lovely striped orange tabby coat and an elegant long tail. He is long limbed and lean. A white patch on his chest is the extra touch of cuteness that makes him irresistible. Personality-wise, he is very affectionate and playful. He loves attention and cuddles from both humans and other cats alike. Mischevious, he can often be found wrestling with my other cats or stealing food from my dog. Tom loves attention and doesn't like to be alone. It would be great if he could find a home with other cats or perhaps a dog. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tom are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",3

950dd345b,"Estee is part of a trio of puppies born to a pair of stray dogs near our house. Her sister was killed by a car a few months ago while her brother suddenly disappeared one day. When we rescued Estee, she was very sick. The vet said she had blood parasite and if we were one day late in rescuing her, she would have died. Estee was put on antibiotics and was in and out of the vet's office for almost 3 months because her condition kept fluctuating. One day she was fine and the next day she will fall sick. We worked hard to make sure she is tick free, flea free and everything free. And we also make sure she eats her food so that she can build up her immune system. Finally in early August , the vet gave Estee a clean bill of health. Estee has, at last, fully recovered from her illness. As long as she doesn't have any ticks, fleas or parasites and she eats proper nutritious meals, the vet said she will be fine. Estee is now a bundle of energy with a real zest for life. Estee is very easy to handle. She is what we call a follower. Estee is a very affectionate puppy and she loves to give her humans kisses. She thrives when she is showered with love and she is not afraid to show her love to us. Estee prefers to do her small business outside but if it is raining or in the middle of the night, she will do it in the potty we provided for her at the car porch. But, she insists on doing her big business outside. At the moment, Estee stands at about 1 foot tall standing on four legs and less than 2 feet in length from the tip of her nose to the tip of her very, very short tail. Estee should be quite small fully grown because her parents are small dogs. Her mother is slightly bigger than a fully grown male cat while her father is only about 1.5 feet in height. Her fur is one glossy black coat. And yes, her ears are as per her picture - one standing upright and the other flopping down. But when she is in alert mode, both ears will be upright. Estee is now learning to bark at strangers that come up to our gate. She will make a good house pet. She is quite good with children too.",3

Her 2 kittens are available for adoption too, and their photos are shown below. Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.",3

Tortoiseshell cats are known for abundance of character and this lady is no different (Read here:). ♥ Sometimes she purrs - sometimes she has a lot to say (yes she talks  meows back). Sometimes she forces herself onto our laps for strokes - and at other times she plants a loving nip or two. ♥ She gets along great with cats her age and kittens. Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing). Otherwise she takes some time to adjust. ♥ Tequila is great with people although we would recommend that only adults or people adjusted to tortie behavior adopt her (as her nippings might not be tolerable for children). ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble without complaint. She has been vaccinated, dewormed and given spot-on prevention against fleas and other parasites. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Tequila must be kept INDOORS at all times (for her own safety). ○ Tequila must be SPAYED at the right age. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc).

742462799,"*PUPPIES FOR ADOPTION!* 6 female puppies, rescued strays. I rescued the entire litter when they were just 2 weeks old (at the end of February). Now 5 months old and located in Johor Bahru. Mixed breed. There are 2 black, 2 light brown, 1 white and 1 darker brown available. I have most of them pictured below. ================================== Full story 🙂 I rescued 8 puppies and their mum at the end of February in Batang Kali, Pahang. I found them seeking shelter in a drain while some kids were throwing rocks at them. Why anyone would want to hurt these tiny creatures is beyond me and just broke my heart!! I wasn't able to take them the day I discovered them but after a guilty, sleepless night I went back to get them all. The mum, Bailey was and is unbelievably gentle and trusting from the start, and just wonderful (she's also looking for a home). She was incredibly skinny and had some skin issues but is now looking times better. Fast forward 5 weeks, after a five hour road trip to Johor Bahru, plenty of love, care and attention, these pups are now 2 months old and ready to find new loving homes. They have all been dewormed, weaned and are in very good health. As they have only just turned 2 months they are now due their first vaccinations, which I will do so the adoption fee is the cost of the vaccination. Please share and help me find them new loving home!",4

bfdff0622,"Little Hailey had a rough beginning to her life. Hailey was rescued about 2 months ago in Desa Sri Hartamas. She was a lone pup most likely abandoned. Hailey was close to death when she was rescued. Severely malnourished and anemic she could barely stand. She had major hookworm infestation and the worse case of fleas I had ever seen. It was heartbreaking to see such a tiny little dog endure so much. Her blood count was so low that a blood transfusion was needed. But like her vet says..Hailey is a fighter and a survivor! She was such a good patient throughout her treatment and rehabilitation. It was so easy to administer her meds and when she got her appetite back she would eat anything I fed her..no complaints, no rejection . Thankfully, she is now a happy and healthy girl. She is also very intelligent. She learned the commands sit and down in a day and would go back to her cage when she's instructed to. Although it breaks my heart to give her up for adoption, I feel she deserves much more than what a condo habitat can offer. Hailey received her first vaccination a few days ago and is due for her 2nd in a month. Her adoption is only open to genuine dog lovers who will take her in as part of the family . Adopter must agree to spay her in February before her first heat. If you are keen on giving Hailey her forever loving home, please contact Kin at.",4

Located at USJ1, Subang Jaya shoplot area and they sleep under cars at a workshop under care of the shop people. All very cute and currently seem healthy.

72bd22c9e,"Hi all, About 5 days ago, a stray female cat gave birth at my neighbour's. For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family. Update (): Coco and Spotty are on milk replacement diet. Took them to the vet,they're putting on weight which means they're healthy and they are also in good shape.

bca4defa4,"You can contact me through whatsapp/line to know about the cat. Conditions For Adopting : 1. No first time adopters without experience. Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",1
0a71e754f,"Blue was rescued in Dec . We were driving in the rain on a flyover when we saw her fly out from underneath a speeding truck. We thought she wouldve been knocked over by the time we made a long big turn, but miraculously she was sitting on the side curb (in between a big drop and fast cars). We thought she was hit as she was so stiff and barely moved. Fast tracking to today.... She has been vaccinated, dewormed and spayed. She has a scar on her tail (indicating a rubberband mark). She is rather timid and has to be an indoor-only cat. She is very loving, prefer rubs rather than hugs so might not do so well with children picking her up. She is okay with other cats and doesnt mind dogs (*have to be introduced properly) (**cat-friendly dogs only).

However, when we took her to get spayed, we realised she was in late pregnancy and so could not spay her immediately. We found her a fosterer and on 19th October , she gave birth to a litter of 6 adorable, healthy puppies. She is currently still nursing them but we will wean the puppies off her on 30th November . She will then be spayed and will be available for adoption to a good forever home from 8th December onwards. She will make a very loving companion and also a very good guard dog. If you are interested in adopting this sweetheart and/or any of her puppies in December , please contact me.",2

cef410e81,"About 3+ weeks ago a cat walked up 4 flights of stairs to my apartment and decided to have 3 kittens behind and under my TV table. Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners. Next step will be to SPCA or any other animal shelter. Attached are some pictures of these adorable kittens. Please contact me if you would like to own these cute furry long tail kittens as I can’t keep them.",2
b1c83d13b,"It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us.",1

24cc193f3,"Fifi ni merupakan salah seekor stray cat yang berada di kawasan perumahan saya. Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone. More photos of Fifie can be seen here:",4

He knows handshake and when I scolded him once, he knows it and will be more alert of his action when he sees my body language. He is a good guard dog even at this young age.

281618ba5,"Shiro is a white lilac-pointed kitty who looks a bit like Taylor Swift. She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors.

25765058c,"Urgently seeking fosterer or adopter! Currently in Jalan Gasing Hospital! But can only stay there til the end o this week!! :( (IF THIS IS YOUR DOG CONTACT ME ASAP) My friend found this poor doggy outside her mother-in-law'a house area. He was just lying there in the muddy ground, and was quite weak to stand up, but was mild mannered. My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there. They did not know who is the owner but he sure was either abandoned or somehow dragged himself? It seems unlikely that he is just lost when his two hind legs are too weak to stand for more than 6 seconds. She called me for help as I had some experience. While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening. Her husband and the lady herself have helped bringing the dog to the vet, as well as financially giving as much as they can. BUT THEY CANT FOSTER/ADOPT THE DOG because they were not used to dogs as well them being muslims. >> Please do contact me via whatsapp if you can foster the dog. He is really sweet, really!! A bit of a lazy whiny bum, but he is gentle. But does not do well with cats, mind you. Overall, he is a good dog. And overall health is alright, just the hind legs are swollen due to arthritis or old age, which needs surgery or physio. But our concern is to find a fostering home first. Financially, we can try to raise fund.",4

Milo and his brother Coffee are seen living a harsh life at a local food court. They were abandoned there when they were pups, despite not getting enough food, they are always being beaten by the food court staff, they stayed on, as that is the only place they know.

Currently, we are fostering these kittens for SPCA until the kittens are 2 months old, where they will be returned to SPCA. For adoption costs, please refer to: FEMALE KITTEN – RM (This adoption fee includes a deposit of RM for spaying. This deposit will be refunded once the queen is spayed before it comes on heat, failing which the deposit will be forfeited.) Rescuer Note: Kittens are not ready to be neutered yet until they are 6 months old. It is very important to neuter them when they are ready, as this will prevent them from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cats are more aggressive.",3

Today, after a few rounds of Whiskas kitten food, a bath and a clean environment, she is bright-eyed and stronger; plays like any normal kitten. She is unafraid of people and loves nothing more than to be with people. She is now toilet-trained on a sandbox. She also does not meow very much, behaves like an intelligent kitten instead of an annoying howler, loves to be petted, purrs an awful lot. Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat. She needs some love and attention, responsible owners who will neuter her and give her the security and care she deserves. I will only be in Malaysia for a few weeks, so am now URGENTLY looking - and hoping - for a home for Tiggy. She deserves better than to be a street cat, left to die or get run over.

81ea0e01a,"Caesar was named after a late (male) Rottweiler - even though she's a female Rottweiler. Caesar is up for adoption as the owner is currently suffering from back injury and could not spend enough time to bring her out for walks and see to her needs. Caesar will be spayed and the adoption fee of RM is to cover for spaying fee, blood test, general check up. She is currently on tick prevention & heart worm prevention (Feb & Mar ). Caesar is NOT a guard dog. She does bark at strangers at the gate occasionally. She's friendly and is very energetic. She plays with anyone. She loves charging and jumping (which may not be suitable for households with small kids - unless with strict supervision and discipline). Caesar is still a puppy, without proper exercise, she is rather destructive (she chews slippers, auto gate cable, car bumper when left unsupervised). With sufficient exercise, she maintains a clean record for the past 3 weeks with us (she did not destroy anything at all). If you are willing to provide her with a good home, please contact me by leaving me a message. We prefer to re-home her to a new home within Klang Valley. Please describe: (1) Your experience with dogs (if any) (2) The environment you intend to provide her with (no cage, no unnecessary tie-up) (3) Please state if you agree to a 1-month trial in which we will visit once or twice to see if it is a good match Please note that those who do not describe the 3 key points will not get a reply from us.

Message from Ex-foster mummy: With a heavy heart I must find her a good home where she is allowed to be dog and be happy. She has been through a lot, I only wish the best for her. Will care for her till she get a home. Terms and Condition: There will be an Adoption fee, PM me and we'll go through a interview process, if successful home visit must be allowed before handing over the dog. Bi-monthly home visit to check up on the dog. Health status: Mild Hip Dysplasia, other than that overall healthy spayed, vaccinated. Location: currently in Ipoh (grandma's house) Summary: I’m Freya Tumbleweed a 7 year old Belgian Shepherd Malinois. I was previously a skinny 13kgs, malnourished abandoned dog found on the streets in Klang until a kind hearted Samaritan found me and posted up about me on Facebook requesting for help. Foster mummy’s friend responded and took me to a vet and a couple of days I was handed over to my foster mummy. I was diagnosed with HeartWorm thankfully it was only Stage 1, I was put on a safer treatment a combination of Doxycycline and HeartGard (Ivermectin) for 6 months. I stayed in foster mummy’s care for close to a year, making sure I was totally recovered and was then send for spaying, I was suspected to be used for breeding. I couldn’t stay too long at foster mummy’s house mainly it was because I couldn’t get along with 2 out of 4 dogs that live there and I had to stay indoors leashed because of foster mummy’s cats safety ( I still had my daily twice a day walks though) and foster mummy and family felt bad for me. On the 11th of November I was send to my foster mummy’s ( now ex-foster mummy) grandma’s house which is 2 hours away since they were looking for another dog to help watch over the house. I managed to adapt myself to my new environment pretty quick. Unfortunately on the 14th of December, I managed to escape the backyard fence through a hole I managed to find and escape to find my friend ( nobody was at home except Grandma). Grandma spotted me and wanted to bring me back, I got a little overzealous over grandma trying to leash me I accidentally caused my grandma to fall (she is in recovery but slow). Grandma now prefers I go back with Ex-foster mummy and other family agree for the sake of her safety. Ex-foster mummy says I’m overall a good/watch dog but I get overzealous at times and I like to jump hug people that is kind of a problem. Long story short Ex-foster mummy is now looking at finding me a new home that has a nice size compound and family that will give me the LOVE/ATTENTION/DISCIPLINE/EXERCISE I need. I get on well in general with other dogs provided they are nice and friendly; I DON’T do well with AGGRESSIVE/CRAZY/DOMINANT DOGS. I will definitely love my humans maybe a tad bit too much, I get along with children (preferably 10 years old and above). I have mild Hip Dysplasia, I will need to take Glucosamine daily.

Unlike Max, she is so young & her forelimbs are not strong enough to give that push like Max, she has to push herself forward for far. Minnie will be seeing Dr Yeoh at the earliest. She was to be put down but Dr. Bun held on. Unlike Max who has Kim, Minnie is hanging on in the clinic.We understand her rescuer has kindly offered to sponsor her rehabilitation & support. The Team will see to all Minnie's need but she NEEDS A MUM. Otherwise, she will just be maintained alive. Her fur is soft. Not only are her eyes soft; they are TOO SOULFUL for a 3 MONTH OLD. Could anyone love her please. Kindly contact Jackie at if anyone could look after her & give her loves that she deserve. Thank you! Update: Minnie is still with us here.",4

They would have been washed away by the river water in a thunderstorm if not for him. 7 are adopted. These 2 are still being nursed by their mother in the light industrial area in USJ 1. I hope to get homes them too or they will end up as strays. They may not survive long as strays because the area where they are, is not safe. A pup from a previous litter of the same mother died hiding from other dogs, in the bushes at the river bank. All I ask is please treat them with kindness and compassion till GOD wants them back. Letting them live their life out in a cage or being tied up is a big no for me. Dog lovers please call me at .",2

103dd7bb1,"This handsome fella is named Hunter. He is a very well-behaved, friendly, yet manja boy. He was found on one odd night where it was almost dark -- he was mistaken for another kitten that resided at the fosterer's home sweet home. Hunter, looked almost identical to the kitten, that only when the fosterer reached up to Hunter to have a closer look that she realised it wasn't the kitten! As much as Hunter is very well loved and taken care of by the current fosterer, she is moving abroad and won't be able to fully take care of Hunter as the house has already been resided by three other cats. Hence, Hunter needs a new home. Hunter is allowed to roam free indoor and outdoor (landed property, garden, etc. - he is strictly not to be put in a cage unless for health confinement!). His favourite food consists of dry cat food with occasional wet food. He eats thrice a day, with snacks in between. He was de-wormed and vaccinated on 20th Feb . There is no adoption fee, however adopters need to be serious in adopting and to provide not only home, but to give ♥♥♥♥♥, proper food as well as safety and medical attention to this handsome fella--feline named Hunter.

4555f9273,"Hi, I have another adult female cat who had babies. They're all about 6 weeks old now so they should be able to be given away. This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. The last one here is called Orey or Oregano. She seemed like the oldest of the bunch as she matured faster than her sisters. She likes to play with her twin and loves to chill and relax. Like her twin, she has already started eating wet food and a bit of dried food. Wouldn't hurt to give some kitten milk, so maybe just get one pack and finish it up. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",1

2e41f018c,"He is called Jellybean because he has always been small in size but strong in character and very, very sweet. He enjoys climbing up onto your shoulder to sniffle your hair and nibble your ear. He grew up with 4 bigger brothers and could not compete with them for milk and space while baby. So he was always the smallest and sickly one. His right eye still looks wonky due to his sickly babyhood. The vet says that he might out grow it as he matures. But if not, it can be corrected (but not necessary). But he is healthy and active now in spite of his wonky right eye. In fact, to make up for his small size, he has grown a big ""I-can-do-it"" attitude and is often the leader of his bigger brothers showing them new places to explore and new games to play. And because of his sickly babyhood, he had developed a very positive outlook in life - whatever happens he will still go, ""Yay! Happy, happy."" He is a well-socialized intelligent kitty because he got the double privilege of growing up with brothers and a mother cat and got regular daily hand-feeding by various kind people since babyhood. So he gets along cheerfully with cats and humans. He loves to play with the kids in the neighbourhood. Born on 15 Nov , he is brother to Caramel and Muffin: And brother to Cupcake and Cookie: It would be ideal if he could be adopted together with Cupcake and Cookie because they are now very close to each other. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-worm treatment was done on 6 December and 6 Jan . * Vaccinated on 20 Jan - 1st jab. * Vaccinated on 24 Feb - 2nd jab * Next vaccination jab is on 24 March . * On 6 Jan - he weighs over g. On 20 Jan , he weighs g. On 24 Feb , he weighs 1.6kg. * Frontline anti-flea spray treatment was applied on 23 Feb . * Able to eat solid food - kibble, wet cat food and chicken. * Litter-box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets regular good fresh food. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure that he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt. I would inquire some details from you to understand your request for a pet.",3

He enjoys lazing on grass, and trotting around (being chased by his human companions for exercise). Blackie Boy responds well to his name, and will look up everytime he's called, and knows the command come. He enjoys food, especially pure chunks of chicken breast, high 5 bread with butter (though the vet's advised not to give him butter as it's bad for dog's pancrease), and his kibbles! He loves crunching on kibbles, and doggie-snacks! Blackie Boy is available to a good home with loving family members who'd spend some time with him and ensure he gets to roam free in the garden. He's ideal for families and especially those who love dogs! Note: he's a penchant to escape from homes where he doesn't feel loved, whereas at his fosterers..even when he strays out, he'd hang around just outside the home, knowing there's love and security there. So, those of you with BIG HEARTS, adopt him!!! Great for older folks, families or singles with lots of love! He's easy to maintain!",3

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies.

bce2ed853,"Onion is described as a Rottweiler and A Belgian Shepard because his body structure is mainly on a Belgian Shepard but parts of his body aren't. Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. Sort of the 'Big Brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outgoing personality to match! Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue. Please message for any inquiries, more pictures or videos, I would be very happy to oblige, cheers!",2

Much appreciated. ------------------------------------ His story : Was rushing to an appointment and saw this lil one hiding under a red car at an area that we are familiar with. Got a friend to check him out while I rush to my appointment and he was not found. After 9 hours, passed by again and saw him at the exact same spot waiting. Once I stopped my car, he came towards me wagging his tail. I'm VERY sure this is a dumping case, because there is no strays around or pregnant female dogs at the nearest strays area. This is what humans are capable of. He is probably just 4 months old, don't even know what is going on or how to fend for himself. He has got dandruff all over his top fur. And he looks so hungry. We named him Leshem, meaning precious. Because life is precious no matter in which form. He has been treated at the vet, showered, dewormed and vaccinated. He is back home with us now while waiting for a forever home he can count on as family. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",3

8c1658988,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",2
4892ceb8d,"I am trying to help 7 puppies find their foster/forever homes. Please help if you can offer a loving home for one or more of them, and can committed to loving and caring for them for life. They are probably 2-3 months old, I can't really tell, very friendly and playful, needless to say, extremely adorable. Their mother is owned by a security guard and is tethered to a little guard station in Bandar Seri Damansara area. She gave birth to 12 puppies and the security guard did his best to feed and take care of them, but only managed to get 5 adopted so far. Leaving 7 puppies with their mama, mostly unsupervised, by the side of a street. They have reached the age where they are getting more and more curious everyday and are starting to venture a little bit farther from their mama each day. Other than the obvious danger, outdoor is no place for these puppies to grow up (with the constant rain etc, they will also need to be dewormed, vaccinated, and spayed/neutered). We bought a 30 pound bag of good quality dog food for the guard to lighten his financial burden of having to feed these many puppies and to give the nursing mama some much needed nutrients, but it will not last long. A friend who lives nearby has promised to check on them and give them treats when he jogs/drives by. We have also left a few toys for them to hopefully keep them entertained and keep them away from the street and from wandering too far away. If you are in the area, or know anyone who is thinking of getting a pet, or have connections to rescue groups, please share the pictures of these puppies and help them find their permanent/foster homes. The security guard can be found at Jalan Damar SD15/3 guard house and can be reached at . Rescues are the best breed!

19af88854,"Hi, this is Romeo! He's a very friendly and happy boy who loves being petted and hugged, and gets along easily with people and other pets. He's also toilet trained to do his business indoors (on a pan) although he will prefer to do his business on grass if he can. Once he trusts you, if you go out for walks, he will follow you around without a need a for lease and will not disturb other passerbys (unless they disturb him, which is a normal reaction for dogs). He knows his name and usually comes when you call, even stands without running when showered. Romeo would make a wonderful companion for families with children or anyone who does not want an overly active dog. He's spayed and had his first vaccination. He has also proven himself to have a strong will to live and enjoy life because early in January , he was found (by me) lying on the street, completely paralysed and injured quite badly. He had gotten into a bad dog fight, suspected to be over a female in heat (hence the name, Romeo!). At the time, Romeo could not move his whole body and only could slightly move his head and needed help even to eat. During that time, he proved his intelligence by toilet training himself to go to the right pee/poo spot in my house just by observing my other dogs! Even when he couldn't stand properly, he would crawl over to the pee pan and do his business. After a few months of physiotherapy and love, thankfully now he can walk and run very well, although not perfectly and he also cannot jump (e.g. over drains, etc). Even with his limitations, he loves every chance he gets to go out and walk around, while at home, he will come to you for love and attention, giving you a silly happy derp face that you can't help but fall in love with! :) By the way, just because he cannot move completely normally does not mean he will not defend you and your house, as he will bark at potential danger, just like any loyal dog would! This happy boy who has a second chance at life is looking for a loving adopter with a big heart to give him a good home! Location in Subang Jaya",4

Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) ◘ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you! :)",1

Kebetulan pd masa tu sy ada bawak Blackwood, terus dia datang dekat dan makan dengan lajunya. I dont think Bobby was a stray cats before since he is very cuddle and didnt run away when I came to him closer. But from his condition, I knew he has been abandoned by his previous owner for a quite long time at these area. Disebabkan ada banyak anjing di kawasan ni selepas jam 3 pagi, (itu pun jiran2 sekeliling yg bagitau sbb sy baru berpindah ke sini) sy amek keputusan untuk bawak ke rumah saya. His fur has been shaved because of hairball here and there, and also has been neutered. Bobby still in recovery process but he is healthy and eat a lot, his fur is getting softer than before because I give him a salmon oil and special food for his fur and his body getting heavier as well :) I would love to keep him as my pet, but I already have five cats in the house. Plus, I tried a lot of things to keep them together,but since I only has female cats before, its hard for Bobby stay here for a long period as he always been bullied by the others. I will accept Blackwood adult 7.5kg and Blackwood Kitten 7.5kg for exchange with Bobby. Bagi sesiapa yang berminat,bole contact saya secepat mungkin.TQ",1

A friend had called to say that a puppy had just suddenly turned up in her housing area all alone. The neighbours threatened to call DBKL eventhough she was such a wee pup. So Nicole Suresh﻿ and I headed over there as soon as we could and picked her up. We gave her a quick bath as she had quite a few ticks and thankfully we managed to get a foster carer for her who will be looking after her until she is ready for adoption. We have decided to call her Dakota as she is so friendly, and the name Dakota literally means friend. She's also very good with other dogs and got along with the foster carer's dogs immediately. We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems. Please SMS or WhatsApp or if you can give this sweetie a good and loving home that she deserves. ******************** TERMS & CONDITIONS FOR ADOPTION 1.

It all started at 25th December . A beagle was found resting under a tree near my garage.He was thirsty and hungry.Realizing it was a pure breed Beagle that could probably be someone else's pet,I temporarily adopted the beagle.However,my own dogs didn't seemed to welcomed him as much as we do by barking at beagle most of the time.So,our neighbour adopted the beagle as they seemed to like the beagle so much.Unfortunately,this wasn't the truth.The neighbour had been very irresponsible by letting the beagle to wander around the streets even on heavy rainy days.Desperated,I asked for explaination and requested that the beagle deserves a better owner.The neighbour didn't seemed to feel sorry about their actions and blamed it on the poor beagle.It had only been a week since they adopted the beagle and we can see significant loss of weight in the beagle.However,they gave an excuse that someone in their family will soon be home to take care the beagle.we decided to give them one last chance to repay what they had done but Unfortunately it turns out to be just another wrong decision.This time,the excuse is that the family member which is responsible for taking care of the beagle is leaving Malaysia soon and...=.= Never ending... BUT... they finally gave in when i requested to get the beagle a Good owner again today-4th january . So right now i'm searching for a good, responsible, loving, and patient owner for this beagle. Having a pet is like caring a baby,Not just another plush toy! So,feel free to contact me if you are ready to give your best and you will certainly be surprised by what you would get from this little beagle!! ^0^ Sincerely, Silver Star",3

Tonight, I separated them from mother cat in preparation for adoption. They have each been scrubbed clean ears to paws. A few fleas removed by shampoo/total wash down and ears are free of mites. Ear mite drops administered and eye cream applied to each cos they have been running and hiding in rain gutters in the back alley, so a bit of precaution since I'm taking them into my home with my own two cats. Tame cos I've been playing with them to let them get used to human contact. A bit shy at first but goes soft and lazy when you give them a good cuddle. Very very healthy and will make good pets. Litter trained in the backyard and feeding on kibbles and able to drink from water bowl. I would prefer them to be adopted as a pair, and the other with an owner who already owns a cat or kitten.

763264fa2,"Scruffy is looking for a good home/family who will spend lots of time with her, take her for long walks and most importantly give her lots of love... ************************************************** This is Scruffy's story: About a month ago, I was at my usual coffee shop in Hulu Kelang this morning, when I saw this tiny puppy wandering round the shop. She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

b857d5ac6,"more about him: 1) loves children 2) very gentle 3) loves the company of another dog (adopting his brother too would be great!!!) 4) curious about cats (but don't attack) 5) loves running 6) enjoys human attention * * * * * This adorable, obedient, affectionate dog was found in Ara Damansara along with two other ""strays"" - one black, another his colour with patches too. He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",3

afe19c37c,Benjie was found loitering at my porch gate 10 days ago. He appeared to be lost and was seriously underfed with his bones showing. His initial appearance lead me to believe he was abandoned near my housing area and somehow found his way to my house by accident. He has a very playful temperament and is ok with small children. No problems with sleeping outside in the porch and he does not bark too much. He understands basic commands like Sit and No. He is also a good guard dog and will bark at strangers at the gate but will stop once ordered to. Healthwise no issues other then being very thin at time of rescue. He is now putting on weight steadily and is much livelier. No ticks on him and he has no injuries. He likes to chew things but once given a chew toy no further problems on that. He has a lot of energy and will make a suitable playmate for kids who like to run about. He is quite loving and craves affection. Currently he lives in my porch and is looking for a loving owner.,1

It was so persistent and traumatizing even for us to hear. We zoned in on where this sound was coming from. It was directly at the back of our home, over a high wall near a neighbouring clubhouse’s tennis courts. We got into the car, ready with food, carrier, gloves and a cloth. Once we got into the grounds, with the help of the security guard on duty, we found in a drain that led to nowhere this teeny tiny puppy, crying pitifully with its last breaths. We caught a hold of her (no resistance was given) and brought her home. After a reviving drink of warm goat’s milk, little Roxanne was all wagging tail, snuggling her way into our laps and licking our hands in gratitude and instant love. She was de-fleadand was given a warm bed, and all she did for two days was eat, wag her tail, snuggle up and sleep. We were unsure if she would make it. But she did.",4

I like playing and running around, but sometimes, I like to sit down and ponder about life, or what I'm having for dinner. Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system.

1077fb67a,"20 September update: Roma has been adopted by Li of Kajang! Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",2

934546487,"Hello, I am sadly giving away my cats for adoption. They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long.

Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up. He's healthy except for a minor skin problem (probably from the stress of being on the streets on his own). The vet thinks he's about months old only... so he's still a puppy.

He is a very sweet and smart cat that loves attention, well trained (recognizes his name and come when you call him, knows few tricks...), he never scratched someone (can be put with children), very sociable. He just hates beeing left alone for too long. He is adorable but unfortunately i have to leave Malaysia in a few months and i can't bring him with me. I am looking for a new loving family that will take good care of him, and that will never leave him on the side of the road. Location: Kuala lumpur, Bangsar",4

He finds it very hard to relax when he's nervous, so he comes across as being a little wound up - but he's just trying to find his place. He likes feeling safe and cozy, doesn't eat much, and eventually will be the sort of kitty that curls up on your lap - making you feel loved after your long day at work. We are migrating to canada, and i'm afraid of what the cold will do to him. He's capable of becoming your best friend, and more importantly, you'll be his best friend - all he needs is time.",2

d46569700,"Help needed ! Mosu Mosu is a mama cat. Her AGE is UNKNOWN. She has pointed colour. Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA. Anyone who likes a cuddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love Mosu Mosu !",1

All her 5 pups have found their homes leaving MaMa behind (she is spayed), making her living on the harsh streets, she is very shy and gentle. often being bullied by other dogs and had to starve. We went to feed her today, we found her hiding under a car. Much to our surprise, she recognized us immediately and made her way to us, tail wagging furiously. It was when I touched her, that it made my heart soar. Despite being beaten and chased away by human, her face tells me she was so longing for that human touch. That few seconds, she was loved, she was special. And that few seconds, meant the world to her. Today we received the sad news that two of Mama Mia's buddies was poisoned to death :( It is very dangerous for this sweet girl to stay on the streets...

9193c38af,"Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation. Good quality food, vet visits, etc will need to be budgeted.",4

When one of our volunteers went to the pet shop, she found Ali to be very frightened with his tail between his legs. He was removed from there and brought to Klang where he has been vaccinated pending neutering. He is currently being fostered and when he was let loose, the first thing Ali did was to romp around and get dirty. He is no longer afraid and is a friendly happy dog. Please help us give Ali a good home.",2

66ad04874,"Hey everyone! So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",4

Now, he has managed to break out of his shell of fear and deemed free of all those dangerous diseases one can find in a dog from the pound. Vaccinated and dewormed. This little guy is full of life and deserves a forever safe home. Please do contact me if you are interested. Please call and not whatsapp or SMS if you are a serious adopter.

I have been keeping her for 3 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Molly, she is 3yr, female, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!",2

My friend has been feeding him but cannot foster the dog because his house is too small to accomodate another pet. He already has one dog and numerous cats.

He is extremely loving and playful and will make a wonderful family pet.",2
d3a6a081b,"Kuro is a sweet and round tuxedo cat with a very sweet demeanor with humans. He loves to cuddle and sit on laps for hours while demanding pets and dispensing purrs generously. Though the same cannot be said when he's with another cat. Even with his brother of the same litter he gets very aggressive and refuses to play. Also at times grows jealous when the other cat gets the attention and it manifests into aggressive sneak attacks. Kuro is a very sweet cat that deserves a home where he can be the one and only cat receiving attention from his owners. He's very sweet, very docile and extremely affectionate. We just hope for Kuro to get a loving home that he can rest assured that he'll be the one and only cat of the house.",3

319e533b6,"My people kept many of us. We were all semi long haired. I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl’s voice. “Aiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.” She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. “Pity they are all short haired” said the girl. “The mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.” I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. “She is falling ill.” “Crap, what about the kittens?” “Not yet. But they will.” I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. “Her name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‘fruitful woman’ because she takes care of so many ” I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. “Shit! Two more in a box” said Olivia. “Tallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise” decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. “AIKS!” I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, “I must try.”",4

They are still very young and need a tremendous amount of care and affection. Note: 1 puppy was adopted in late July . GENUINE ADOPTERS ONLY - If you are thinking of adopting puppies, I urge you, do not think of adopting them based on ""beauty"" and ""cuteness"". Dogs will mature (obviously) so their ""cute puppy"" factor will soon be gone, but they can be your steadfast companions for a significant number of years. They will be a lot of work to look after, but they will give you a lot of affection and happiness in return. I humbly request a small adoption fee of RM50 per puppy as I had them dewormed and deticked at the vets, though this fee is not compulsory. Note: I do not know what breed these puppies are, nor how large they will grow to. I put ""medium-size"" based on the size of their mother.",4

2483a71c4,"Creaky arrived on our doorstep from the jungle, making a strange creaking sound, and so thin every rib stood out. For the first week, she couldnt keep much food down, but after a month she has blossomed into a really beautiful cat with amazing markings on her face - and spots on her tummy - and a superbly long tail. We had her neutered. as after a week of food she went straight on heat, and attracted some very devoted toms, one is still her closest friend. Perhaps we should have had her put down, as we knew we were only here for a few weeks - but she is such a wonderful, affectionate and intelligent creature, we simply couldnt. Please can someone give her a home - she is clean in the house, a joy to have around, a little vocal - her voice is still a bit strange, possibly some Siamese from somewhere - a little needy - with the most amazing huge aquamarine eyes. I can bring her down to Kuala Lumpur to any proffered kind home.",3

85fd5df90,".: I as the owner decided not to give up on Zorro, so he has been with me all these while..however, im in need of favor and am looking for a temporary fosterer ...tops 3 months or less..preferably someone with landed property and very gentle with Zorro as he is quite a scaredy cat..he is afraid of strangers and large dogs but he is very sweet once he knows you. preferably someone staying nearby seputeh, brickfields, midvalley , bangsar area as i would be dropping by to pick him up for grooming or replenish his food. Yes all his stuff will be provided: -his favourite kibbles -his favourite wet food -his favourite treats -his towel, shampoo, conditioner, brush -his vitamins Anything he needs i will provide and i usually send him for full grooming once in 2 months or once a month depending on the weather. Like now its blazing hot so i will send him for grooming before giving him to the fosterer. If there is anyone interested let me know and of course i would need to scan through the fosterer as Zorro means a lot to me. If you are planning to get a dog for a pet but not sure if you can handle well this is your chance to have a pooch at ur place temporary to see if dogs suitable for u.. Zorro is a sweet dainty little dog.. He can be quite shy with strangers but once he is used to u, he can be very hyper when he wants to play. Though he is 5 years old, he can still behave like an excited puppy. He loves jumping around and skipping..He loves to 'lepak' in a small space like under his cage or the washing machine or the couch. He is very alert when i call for him and he knows quite a number of commands like sit, down , stay , no , in etc but his signature trick is ""malu"" and that's when he'll cover his eyes with his paws.Since he is a smart fella, i believe there are still room for him to learn new things.. Whenever i take him for a walk i dont need a leash bcoz he wont stray far for me and it will always be him who wants to go back inside. He is only meant for serious adopter who is a genuine animal lover looking for a lifetime companion. I would appreciate much if I could send him to his new home if there is any kind-hearted soul out there willing to take him and make him part of your family.",4

deb0ad8cd,"Dear all, My dog is currently under foster. Thank you all for paying attention to my dog's case. Anything I shall update you all again :) Below is a snippet of my previous post : -------------------------------------------------- Molly is a happy dog. She is active, loves kids, loves adults, basically just anyone she can play with. She is alert against strangers approaching the house, hence a good guard dog. She is friendly towards anyone near to her owner, hence a good friend. She is friendly towards every member of the house, hence a good house dog. She is toiler trained. She can do it on grass and newspapers. She is obedient, and manja. She never bites. She is happy when people are around. I have been having her since she was 2 months old, and I grew her up in the condominium. She doesnt bark all day, and doesnt simply bark. She only barks when people and cats are around. She is a perfect dog everywhere. She sits still in cars, and doesnt jump around. She is a good passenger too. I love her very very much. Its very very sad to leave her for adoption, but I have no choice. I have to move to a house where no dogs are allowed. All places I asked do not allow dogs. I have no idea how. I really wish someone with a good heart for dogs can take her in. She is up for adoption from today onwards. January is the dateline and I have not found any friends who wants to take in another dog, as they are either occupied with dogs at their home , or they are afraid of dogs. Please contact me if you are interested. ------------------------------------------------",4

On 16 Sept, I found her again outside of her owners home with a bag of frieskies on the floor. It seems like the owner has move out from the place (I saw all the unwanted stuff in front of the place). The cat seems to be domesticated and can't live on its own. I took her into my place but I can't afford to adopt the cat for a long time. I'm still a student and always at the library doing research or go to class.

She likes to be among people, responds when people talk to her and know how to use the litter box.

5f5bd40ca,"This kitten was shivering near the lift at my apartment one day. Mommy cat was no where to be found. He followed me around while I was looking for mommy cat, then decided to follow me home. He has been dewormed and will be sent for vaccinations on the 19th of Oct. He is very affectionate and active, litter box-trained and learns fast. He has an adorable meow (more like ""eow!"") Most of the photos of him were taken while he was asleep, because he is hyperactive when he is awake! As no one is at home all day while I am at work, he is starved of attention, and is confined to a room in my tiny apartment. I leave him with many toys and play with him until I am exhausted every night, but he still looks like he is bursting with energy and sometimes tries to run away. Perhaps it is not enough for him :( I feel sorry for him, and hope that someone can give him a loving home which suits him, and all the attention he deserves!",1
0a20eaed8,"Latte is one of three kittens that were rescued from an owner who neglects them. They are kept in a small cage daily for several months. They were not fed regularly, especially in the last few days before the owner gave them up to us. Due to the small space, one of them would always end up sleeping on the dirty litter, or topple their water and food bowls - which were not replaced. I We could not bare to watch anymore, so we pestered the owner to give them to us. We felt that it is better for them to be with someone else, or roam around the streets to find their food rather than being kept like prisoners in their cage. They were hungry and smelly when we took them and would purr contentedly as soon as we touch them. We already have 5 cats - all rescued kittens - sharing our small apartment, we hope that you could give Latte a loving home.",2

74d7a26bc,"Hi everyone! Here is Sandy! She is a 6/7 months old female cat. We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging. Please be aware that a cat is a long term engagement (a cat can live an average of 15 years). So if you think that Sandy is THE one, I will be happy to introduce her to you.",3

f3b52a69c,"'Old doesn't make one redundant'...This is the story of a special girl with every loving name. She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin",2

90204109f,"I have 2 dogs, both unwanted pups which I adopted. 3 days ago, my uncle asked me to take in another pup. Today, someone in my vicinity complained to Mpsj that I'm having 3 dogs & I got a warning that I'll be compounded within 3 days. My pets & compounds are clean, well behaved and licenced, but some ppl are just plain nasty. Miji is very manja and a small eater. She can understand commands like sit, hand, get in the cage, wait, kiss, hug and carry. She is also very alert, thus makes a good guard. I thought since she's spayed and vaccinated, she'll stand a better chance to be adopted as the new owner won't need to pay more than her annual jabs. But if someone rather take the 4 months old puppy, pls call too. I wish I can rescue all 3 of them, but I will be breaking the rules. I hope a kind hearted person who likes small dog will respond ASAP and will treat Miji well. Please help before Mpsj comes again.",1

b310f969f,"Hi! My name is Melody. I am about 4 months old. I was born in the bushes somewhere in Sri Petaling on the 9th September . I was sent to PAWS Mission shelter in early November and was fostered shortly after that by Richard. When Richard took me home, I was quite sick and was quickly taken to the Vet clinic where I was diagnosed with tick fever and put on blood transfusion immediately. I had to stay overnight at the clinic, which terrified me. I remember the vet telling Richard that I was whining a fair bit in my cage. After a few more vet visits and with lots of medication (yuckkhh!!) and supplements, I feel much, much better now. That was 2 months ago. I now have a very healthy appetite and weigh about 6.5 kg. Richard has been feeding me kibbles (with cod liver oil & supplement topping), canned food and rice cooked with liver and chicken(yummy!!). I also get those occasional treats when I'm able to follow some simple instructions like sit and shake hands (Shhh - don’t tell anyone but I am only doing this so that I can get the goodies ). I'm also very energetic now and enjoy running around in the yard and playing fetch the ball/bone/tree branch with Richard. I was vaccinated on 20th December after given a clean bill of health by the vet. As Richard is unable to look after me permanently :(, I am looking to be part of a loving new family :). I am very affectionate, intelligent and loyal – I won’t try to leave home. Like most puppies though, I occasionally love shoes & slippers, digging dirt to bury my goodies and playfully nip Richard’s hand (he knows I’m just playing with him). I am still maturing and like human kids need to be shown where my boundaries are. If you like my story and would like to adopt me as part of your family, please call Mrs. Lai at or Richard at .

78b51f6a0,"If your cat is lonely, here is the perfect solution: a cat who loves other cats. BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months. Trial period available. *COMMITMENT TO SPAY BonBon IS A COMPULSARY!*",4

However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too! And a major plus point is she's up to date with all her vaccines and she is neuter (save u the trouble)! We're located in klang valley pj area, very close to Sunway Pyramid! Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. The best way to get me would be via telephone! Thank you for viewing ^_^",2

e2f39a17e,"Fun-loving ginger cat looking for a home. Already spayed. I'll be moving overseas so I would like to look for a new home for her. Preferably a place where she can have access to the outdoors. She's an outdoorsy cat. She's very curious and confident. Has no fear of anything and very playful and active. She's a tomboy so she has no dainty manners. She can probably get along well with dogs and active cats but if you have an existing cat who is gentle, jumpy and scared of stuff I wouldn't recommend her. Ginger will cause your gentle cat a lot of distress. She is about 6 years old. She's blind in one eye because she fell off my balcony as a kitten but it doesn't impair her in any way. She loves people but doesn't really like cuddles. She'll only rub against your legs when she wants food. She is litter trained. Hates pine litter though. She enjoys running around at full speed and enjoys being chased. She eats raw chicken and regular cat kibble. She's well mannered when it comes to human food. Doesn't seem remotely interested in my cooking. She dislikes fish. She loves boxes and being brushed.",2

We took her home and fed her as she was malnourished when we found her at 1 month old. She seemed to be eating well and seemed very happy but then 2 days later we found out she had contracted the Parvo virus. Complicated by her malnourishment she was in dire need of medical attention and was hospitalized and put on drips for 5 days. After she was released from hospital she had gotten over the worst of the parvo but still very weak and needed special care. Even through all the pain she never failed to wag her tail and smile at us whenever we were with her. She was a real fighter! We fed her high quality kibble to make sure she would bulk up but the virus seemed to have restricted her growth. Now after 2 months of intensive care, good food and love, Lucy is now a healthy, happy, slender puppy who shows no signs of the struggle she had in her early life.

Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he can’t find him, he’ll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). He’s a morning cat – will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes – Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. He’s the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper – can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on – handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but he’s got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. They’re both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as I’ll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one. Call or SMS me at if you’re interested.",4

My apologies if the above questions seem to be intrusive or offensive in any way but we are looking for a truly loving and responsible adopter for the felines. All this resulted from our experience in rescuing and rehoming cats. Please note that there is no right or wrong answers as we just wish to learn more about the feline’s potential adopter before making the decision. Thank you. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow.

138c79a01,I found this orphan kitten at a student’s house. They told me she doesn’t seem to have a mother anymore and has been begging them for food. It’s been weeks and there’s still no mother or owner claiming her. She’s quite skittish and afraid of people in the beginning that might be a reaction to how other people have been treating her. Which is why I finally decided to take her home with me. We already have four adult cats and can’t really afford to take in one more. So I hope she can go to a kind and understanding owner that will treat her well. She is a bit love deprived so she loves the attention and meows for you to pet her. She knows how to use the litter box properly and hasn’t caused any problems. We have lotsa kitten food that will be given along with the kitten if you choose to take Seremban/Selangor/KL.,1

Mei Xin jie jie is a very sweet girl and she will be playing with me when I get to my new home.I love her too! That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most. Faith is toilet trained and she's fleas/ticks/mites free.

8f1bdc253,"Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",2

4effbea00,"Husky was rescued and fostered by me at the moment. He is looking for a good home and family that can love and treat him as part of the family. Husky Boy is still young and need love, patients and attention, so must take care him well. He is very alert and will guard your house faithfully in return for tender loving care (however if you're purely looking for a guard dog who you can tie in your porch all day long to take care of your house, Husky is not for you). He is cute and healthy, playful and very good with humans and other dogs. As he is used to being indoors and loves being around with people and having company. However, if you do have a big compound for him to run and play, he will love it too because he was very active. Terms and conditions for adoption are: 1)MUST be sprayed/neutered (Cost will be considered if sharing required) 2)MUST continue with his annual vaccinations. 3)Only suitable for landed properties as Husky needed a landed property with big compound to move around. 4)MUST NOT be caged or chained for long periods of time. 5)MUST be provided with sufficient shelter from sun and rain. 6)Must have proper food and water for him (No bones allowed) 7)MUST walked him every morning and evening. 8)Must be able to afford veterinary care if he falls ill. 9)Must upkeep monthly tick treatment and Heartgard prevention to prevent tick fever and heartworms (also to prevent tick infestation in your home and transmission of ticks to your family). 10)Not suitable for factory, workshop or farm use. 11)During the stage of adoption, do allow home visit or, email picture or sent what's app picture, so that as a rescuer, I can ensure that Husky Boy is adjustable well to his new environment with his new loving family in his forever home. If you can fulfill the above conditions then you are a suitable and caring adopter for Husky Boy. Please contact me at for more info of the above adoption. “Only serious adopters who can look after Husky Boy himself/herself will be entertained” because as a rescuer, I definitely don’t tolerate ‘Animal Cruelty’ Thank you for your kind consideration and understanding to the above terms and conditions.",3

6a9d18d89,"Woof! Can you please be my master and give me a forever home? My name is Lucy. I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe? Call Ms. at to schedule a play date with me.",3

He was treated at the vet and has recovered from yeast infection. He used to scratch and chew himself until he is injured. He still requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his hind legs as he may have met an accident before we foster him and he is currently undergoing holistic treatment. He is allergic to certain food, hence, he has limited choices in food but he can take certain kibble. He is friendly with humans and dogs, except when he thinks the human is trying to apply antiseptic cream on him when he was injured back then. He growled and snapped as he was in pain. Hence, it is best that he does not go to a home with very young children as they may accidentally harm him and he would snap. He is toilet trained and stays indoor. He hardly barks.

We can arrange a meet-up somewhere public so you can meet her in advance before deciding. Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested.

I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ♥ I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ♥ Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ♥ Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ♥ I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ♥ I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ♥ I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ◘ Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

I am unable to keep her as I have two dogs and one of them is waiting for the opportunity to attack her. Potential adopter need to ensure she will be kept indoors, supervised when outdoors, and no unnecessary caging allowed. Potential adopter must be financially independent and committed to love her and provide her with the necessary vaccination and medical care for the duration of her life.",2

7a54b760e,"6 Jan :30: We found this poor dog (male) wandering around the few blocks of shophouses doing wholesale clothing opposite Kenanga Wholesale City (Ho Ching Yuen). He wears a very dirty blue collar, with no I.D tag. According to those shop owners and some workers there, he has been wandering around the area for the past 2 days. Looked very hungry so we tried feeding him some corn that i had bought, but he was very timid, he will not approach the food if we put the it on our palm, so we leave it on the floor and move away, and he ate them. When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking). Unfortunately this dog shelter in Cheras is also very full, i begged them and they agree to temporary shelter him when I go look for fosterer or adopter. This poor boy looks very unkept right now, but I believe he will looks better after grooming. I know many will not give this boy a second look, but I beg you to please give this boy a chance to be loved. Please adopt over buying.",2
504ce7187,She is a very well behaved kitten who loves being around people. She likes playing and surprisingly loves showers! Theres' never a boring moment with this one. Her fur is really soft too. We wish we could keep her but not having a maid it is getting too difficult taking care of two cats.,2
